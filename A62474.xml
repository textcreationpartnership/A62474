            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The young King thus trained up in prejudice againſt them, and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over from his youth inured to cruelty, and the ſlaughters of his Subjects even in cold blood, whereof by the D. of Guiſe he had been early made a ſpectator, was ſcarce out of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority when he was ivited by the Pope,<note place="margin">V.

And therefore at an <hi>enterview at Bayonne</hi> between him with his Mother, and his Siſter the Queen of Spain accompanied with the D. of Alva, having by the way had ſecret conference at Avignon with ſome of the Pope's truſty Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (the Pope having perſwaded that meeting, and earneſtly preſſed the King of Spain himſelf to be preſent at it) it was concluded to cut off the chief heads of the Proteſtants, and then, in imitation of the Sicilian Veſpers, to ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the reſt to the laſt man. But the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign

But that being contrary to the deſign to effect the buſineſs by stratagem and ſurprize, it was in few months compoſed for the preſent; but ſhortly after, when the ſame deſign was again perceived to be carried on, and the like inevitable danger approached as neer as before, was again renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former manner, and continued ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what longer and hotter than before.<note place="margin">V.

                  <head>THE HISTORY OF THE MASSACRES OF THE Proteſtants at PARIS, and many other places in FRANCE, in the Year of our Lord, 1572.</head>

                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 51.</note> which was appointed the<note n="*" place="margin">Auguſt 18th.</note> 15th. of the Kalends of September; the King by Letters ſolicits Coligni, that he ſhould come to Paris, having before given in charge to Claudius Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Provoſt of the Merchants, that he ſhould ſee to it, that no diſturbance did ariſe upon Colignie's coming to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31919:6"/> Likewiſe <hi>Proclamation</hi> was <hi>publiſhed</hi> the third of the Nones of July,<note place="margin">July 5th.</note> when he was at <hi>Caſtrum Bononiae,</hi> about two miles from the City, wherein it was forbidden, that any of what condition ſoever ſhould dare to renew the memory of things paſt, give occaſion of new quarrels, carry piſtols, fight duels, draw their ſwords, eſpecially in the King's retinue at Paris, and in the Suburbs, upon pain of death. But if any difference ſhould ariſe among the Nobles concerning their Honour or Reputation, they ſhould be bound to bring their plaint to the Duke of Anjou, the King's Deputy throughout the whole Kingdom, and to pray juſtice of him: if they were of the Commons, they ſhould betake themſelves to the High Chancellor de l'Hoſpital: if it ſhall happen among thoſe that ſhall not be in the Court, but in Paris, they ſhall go before the ordinary Magiſtrate. It was alſo provided by the ſame Proclamation, that thoſe who were not of the Courts of any of the Princes or Nobles, or of the Retinue of others, or were not detained upon ſome neceſſary buſineſs, but were of uncertain abode and habitation about Paris or the Suburbs, ſhould depart from the Court &amp; City within 24 hours after the publication of this Edict, upon the ſame pain of death. This was publiſhed for three days together, with the ſound of Trumpet in the Court, and through the City, and it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the publication ſhould be repeated week by week upon the Sabbath-day. Alſo there was adjoyned to the guards of the King's body for his greater ſecurity, a guard of 400 choice Souldiers; all which <hi>Coligni</hi> full of confidence and good aſſurance ſo <hi>interpreted,</hi> as if the King deſirous of the publick Peace, did (only) prepare a contrary ſtrength againſt thoſe which were ſeditious, and movers of troubles. Therefore he <hi>comes into the City,</hi> though <hi>many</hi> were greatly <hi>diſturbed at it:</hi> to whom, when they importunately dehorted him both by letter and word of mouth, he, after he had given them thanks, anſwered in one word; <q>That he was reſolved now that Peace was concluded, and things paſt forgotten, to rely upon the faith of the King, and that he had rather be dragged through the ſtreets of Paris, than to take up Civil Arms again.</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31919:6"/>2. Among other <hi>letters</hi> there was one <hi>brought to him</hi> being now come to Paris, written very ſmartly after this manner. <q>Remember that it is an eſtabliſhed Decree of the Papiſts, upon the account of Religion, and confirmed by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Councils, that Faith is not to be kept with hereticks; in the number of which Proteſtants are accounted. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber alſo that Proteſtants upon the account of the former Wars, do lie under an eternal odium; ſo that it is not to be doubted but this is the Queens reſolution, that Proteſtants be rooted out by any means whatſoever. Add to this that it cannot be, but that a woman that is a ſtranger, and an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, deſcended of the race of the Popes, (whom they op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) and of a Florentine and guileful nature, ſhould ſtudy all extremities againſt her enemies. Conſider moreover in what School the King was educated, in which he drew in with his milk under his good Tutors this Doctrine; that he ſhould make it a ſport to ſwear and forſwear, to uſe the name of God profanely, to defile himſelf with Whoredomes and Adulteries, to diſſemble his Faith, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Counſels, to ſet his countenance (according to occaſion). And that he might be accuſtomed to the effuſion of the bloud of his Subjects, he was taught from his childhood to behold the ſlaughters and butcheries of<note n="*" place="margin">And of men alſo, <hi>v. l.</hi> 24. <hi>p.</hi> 275.</note> beaſts: that he is ſetled in this perſwaſion to ſuffer no Religion in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom but that which may uphold his ſtate, (according to the opinion of his Maſter Machiavel) otherwiſe it would never be at Peace, ſo long as two Religions flouriſhed in it, and that it was inſtilled into his ears that the Proteſtants did decree to ſpoil him of his Life and Empire. And therefore he would never ſuffer the Proteſtants who had once, whether upon a juſt or unjuſt cauſe, taken up Arms againſt him, to enjoy the benefit of his Edict, but that he would with Arms revenge what was done with Arms againſt him; nor would he look upon himſelf obliged to keep his Covenants which he had entred into with his armed Subjects. Theſe are the Arts of Princes, the Elements of Policy, the Arcana Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii. So Commodus of old commanded Julian, whom he owned and embraced as his Father, to be ſlain. Thus
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31919:7"/> Antonius Caracalla, under pretence of muſtering, ſlew the prime youth of the City. So Lyſander cut the throats of eight hundred Mileſians called together under pretence of friendſhip and ſociety. So Sergius Galba raged upon ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Spaniards: and lately by the command of Antonius Spinola, the chief men of the Iſle of Corſica were called to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to a Feaſt, and ſlain. In our memory did Chriſtiern a King of a barbarous nature uſe the ſame arts in the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre of Stockholm. So heretofore Charles 7, though recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the Duke of Burgundy, yet abſtained not from kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, though he begged for his life. Nor are the diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that the King lately had with his mother at Blois un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. For when in a jocular manner profanely uſing, as his cuſtom is, the name of God, he asked her whether he had not acted his part handſomely at the coming of the Queen of Navar? the Queen anſwered that he had begun well, but theſe beginnings would little advantage him unleſs he proceeded; But I, ſaid he, with often repeated oaths, will bring them all into your toils. From theſe words, the truth whereof you may be aſſured of, you ought to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, and if you are wiſe get out of the City, and ſo from the Court, as from a moſt filthy ſink, with all the ſpeed as may be.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Coligni</hi> having read this letter, though he was not a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle troubled at it, yet that he might not ſeem altogether to neglect the admonitions and intreaties of his friends, made anſwer; <q>That there was no place left for theſe ſuſpitions, that he could never perſwade himſelf that ſo great perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs could enter into ſo good a King, than whom France for this many years never had a better. That Anjou indeed was more averſe to the Proteſtant party, but that hatred would now ceaſe, even out of reſpect to the affinity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted with the King of Navar. For the reſt, the League entred into with England, and that which the King was now making with the Proteſtant Princes of the Empire, did ſufficiently ſhew how he ſtood affected to the Proteſtants, when as he would have one of the Sons of the Elector Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latine in his retinue: and ſome one of the Engliſh Nobles,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:31919:7"/> as Leiceſter or Burgleii, who were moſt forward for Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Moreover he had given his Faith to the Prince of Orange and Naſſau his Brother concerning aids againſt the Spaniards, and that a great ſupply was preparing in the place of thoſe who were routed under Jenlis their leader. That John Galeacius Fulgoſius, who lately returned from Florence, did aſſure them, that Coſunus would lend the King two hundred thouſand Aurei towards that War. That the King's Ambaſſador did carefully pry into the counſels of the Duke of Alva, and daily acquaint the King with them. That this he knew every day from the King. That the Navy that Philip Stroſſy and Polinius Garda do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Broage, and upon the Coaſts of Poictou was not prepared to any other uſe but to diſturb the Spaniſh Fleet, which being done, it ſhall go to help the Prince of Orange at Fluſhing. As for himſelf and his own particular ſafety, all might be ſecure of that; for that he through the King's means is reconciled to the Guiſes, each engaging their Faith to the King, that they would neither of them hereafter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peach one the other. Laſtly, that the King did all he could to make Peace at home and War abroad, and that he might transfer the War into the Low-Countreys, and againſt the Spaniards. Wherefore he prayed the Author of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and others that are of his mind, that they would no more with theſe ſuſpitions trouble his mind, which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up with more weighty buſineſſes, and better deſigns, but rather that they would, joyning their prayers with his, beg of God that he would proſper things ſo well begun, and bring them at laſt to an happy end, for the good of the Church and Kingdom.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>The ſame things</hi> were <hi>written to Coligni from the Rochel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi> which he did in as friendly manner take off with all mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration and conſtancy. Therefore when they could not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him from that mind, they ſet upon <hi>the King of Navar</hi> with Letters dated 6 of the Eids of July,<note place="margin">July 10th.</note> in which they <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort him</hi> upon the ſame accounts, that he ſhould take care of himſelf, and not go to Paris. He was then at the Nuptials<note n="†" place="margin">Vid. l. <hi>50.</hi> p. <hi>787.</hi>
                     </note> of Henricus Condaeus his Unckle's Son, and Mary of Cleve
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31919:8"/> his near Kinſwoman, which were celebrated at Blandia a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle of Jo. Roan Marchioneſs of Rotelin, who was Mother to Frances of Aurleans<note n="*" place="margin">Vid. l. <hi>35.</hi> p. <hi>559.</hi>
                     </note> laſt Wife to Lewis of Conde, within the juriſdiction of Melun. Therefore he deſpiſing the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of his Friends, the Nuptials of the Prince of Conde being finiſhed, <hi>comes to Paris</hi> with him, and a great retinue of Proteſtants in the beginning of Auguſt, where <hi>new delays</hi> are purpoſely invented by the Queen; for whereas at firſt there was hope given of favour to be obtained from the Pope by the Cardinal of Lorain, who was then at Rome, to remove the obſtacle of proximity and difference in Religion, a Breve was brought to Charles Cardinal of Burbon, deſigned to finiſh the buſineſs; wherewith notwithſtanding he ſaid he he was not ſatisfied: therefore he deſired another more full might be ſent from Rome, wherein it might be more amply provided for him. Therefore the King laid the fault of the delay upon the Cardinal of Burbon, who he ſaid, by way of ſcorn, was tied up by ſuperſtition, and I know not what ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of conſcience; and by that means great injury was done to his Margarite (ſo he called his Siſter) who bore it very impatiently to have the fruit of her ſo long expected joy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. When in the mean time <hi>Coligni preſſed that the publick proclaiming of the Low-Countrey War</hi> ſo often deliberated about, and approved of, and now whether he would or not begun, might be no longer deferred, he again made delays, and declined it, and often replied to him, importuning him, that he had not any Counſellor or Officer of his Army to whoſe faithfulneſs, induſtry and diligence he could commit ſo great an affair. For ſome were wholly addicted to the party of the Guiſes; others had other faults of their own: of his Secretaries there was only Bernardus Fiza whom he could entruſt with this ſecret. At laſt it was agreed that the affair ſhould be committed to Momorancy and Fiza: with which ſhews of unfeigned familiarity, as he took it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous freedom, Coligni being deceived, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade himſelf any thing otherwiſe than of truly Kingly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, or think hardly of the moſt excellent King.</p>

                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:31919:8"/>6. Amidſt theſe delays (thoſe) things, as it ſhould ſeem, being altogether compoſed, about which before there was a difference among the Conſpirators, there came <hi>Letters</hi> by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret comport <hi>from the Kings Ambaſſador with the Pope,</hi> in which the King is certified of a diſpenſation now granted, and ſhortly to be ſent from Rome by Poſt, wherein the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous conſcience of Burbon was fully ſatisfied: therefore when, upon the 16th. of the Kalends of September,<note place="margin">Auguſt 17th.</note> they were <hi>contracted</hi> by Cardinal Borbon in the Louvre, the next day after <hi>the Nuptials</hi> were <hi>celebrated.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An high Scaffold is erected before the gates of the great Church, by which they deſcended by ſtairs unto a lower Scaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold, which being on every ſide railed in to keep off the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, did lead through the Church to the inner apartment commonly called the Chore. From thence another Scaffold encompaſſed with rails did receive thoſe that went out of the Chore toward the left gate, which reached to the Biſhop's Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; thither came out of the Louvre with all Royal Pomp, and moſt magnificent ſhew, the King, the Queen-Mother, with the Brethren the Dukes of Anjou and Alanſon, the Guiſes, the Colonels of the Horſe, the chief Peers of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom leading along the Bride, who lodged that night in the Biſhop's Palace. And from the other part, the King of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var, with the Princes of Conde and Contie his Couſins, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligni Admiral of the Sea; Franciſcus Count de la Roche-fou-eault, and a great company of the Proteſtant Nobles, who came together out of all Provinces of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>When the King had aſcended to that higher Scaffold, the Ceremonies in manner as was agreed being performed by Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Borbon, the King and Navar with his Party came by the lower Scaffold into the Chore, where having placed his Wife before the great Altar to hear Maſs, he with Coligni and Count de la Roche-fou-eault, and the other Nobles of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue went into the Biſhop's Palace by the contrary door afore mentioned; from whence after Maſs was ended, being recalled by D'Anvil, he came into the Chore again, and kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his new Bride before the King, Queen, and the Brethren, when they had entertained one another ſome little while with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:31919:9"/> diſcourſe, they returned into the Biſhop's Palace, where din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was provided. And I well remember when as Maſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, I was admitted through the rails into the Chore, and ſtanding nigh to Coligni, while I fixed my eyes upon him, and curiouſly obſerved him, I heard him ſay, diſcourſing with d'Anville, and looking up to the Enſigns faſtned up and down, and the ſad Monuments of the Battel of Baſſac and Moncountour, <q>That ere long theſe being taken down, others more pleaſing ſhould be ſet up in their places:</q> which words, then he meant of the Low-Country War, which as he thought was now reſolved upon, others interpreted as though he had thoughts of a new Civil War, which he ſo much abhorred.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. After Dinner they went into the Palace, where a royal Supper was prepared, and all orders of the City and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, together with with the Courts of Accounts, Cuſtoms and Treaſury are entertained according as is uſual in a moſt ſumptuous manner: a ſhort time was ſpent in dancing; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards <hi>interludes</hi> were brought in. The repreſentation of three Rocks ſilvered over, upon which the three Brethren, the King, the Duke of Anjou, and Duke of Alanſon did ſit, and ſeven more, upon which Gods and Sea-monſters were ſet, which followed, being drawn along in Coaches, and were brought through the great Hall of the Palace, which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by a triumphal arch in the middle, and when they made a ſtand, ſome choice Muſitians recited Verſes in their own Tongue, compoſed by the beſt of their Poets. And thus a great part of the night being ſpent in interludes, they after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards betook themſelves to their reſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>next day</hi> being not able to riſe before the Sun was got high, at three a clock after-noon they went to dinner at the Duke of Anjou's Palace, where after dancing they went to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the evening to the Louvre.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>day following</hi> being <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> running at Tilt, and <hi>interludes</hi> which had been a long while in preparing, were <hi>exhibited at the Cardinal Bourbon's Palace:</hi> there were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented upon the right hand the Manſions of the bleſſed, and a little below the Elyſian-fields poſſeſſed by 12 Nymphs, on
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31919:9"/> the other ſide on the left-hand was repreſented Hell flaming with fire and brimſtone, and full of ſprights and frightful ghoſts. The Brethren, the King, the Duke of Anjou, and the Duke of Alanſon defended Paradiſe as they called it: which many Knights Errant ſeeking to break into, of whom Navar was Captain; they were every one of them repulſed, and at laſt thrown headlong down into Hell. Then Mercury riding upon a Cock, and together with him Cupid came ſliding down to the defendants, and then after much diſcourſe with them returned into Heaven. Then the three defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants came to the Nymphs wandring in the pleaſant green fields, and led them into the middle of the Hall, where the Spectators were with much pleaſure entertained with new Dances about the Fountain for a full hour. Then the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants being prevailed upon by their entreaties, the Knights Errant that were ſhut up in Hell were releaſed; who preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a confuſed skirmiſh break their ſpears: at laſt the Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder that was laid by pipes about the Fountain being fired, fire-broak forth with a great noiſe, and conſumed all their Scenes, and ſo all departed.</p>
                  <p>This ſhew was variouſly interpreted, for that the aſſailants who were moſt of them Proteſtants, did in vain attempt to get into the ſeats of the bleſſed, and were afterwards thruſt down into Hell: for ſo they put a mockery upon the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and others did bode that it portended ſome miſchief. However, certain it is, that <hi>Francis E. of Momorancy,</hi> whether ſuſpecting ſome evil, or being indiſpoſed by reaſon of the toſſing of the Sea, as lately returned from his Ambaſſy in England, having obtained leave of the King, <hi>went to Chantilly</hi> for his healths ſake; leaving in the Court Henry d'Anville, Carolus Meruvius, and Gulielmus Thoraeus (his) Brethren, and that very happily for that moſt Illuſtrious Family:<note place="margin">V. Da. p. <hi>370.</hi>
                     </note> for it was the general opinion, that the plotters of the following Maſſacre would have comprehended them all in this conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy, had they not feared that Momorancy, who was now ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, would have revenged it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>next day</hi> being <hi>Thurſday,</hi> there was running at <hi>Tilts</hi> held in the Court-yard of the Louvre, in which on the one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31919:10"/> ſide the King and his Brethren, together with the Duke of Guiſe, and the Duke of Aumale in the habit of Amazons; and on the other ſide the King of Navar, with his party in Turkiſh habits, contended with their launces; Scaffolds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet up on either ſide, from which the Queen-Mother, the King's Wife, Lorain, and all the Court-Ladies beheld the ſports.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Two days before the Counſel concerning the Maſſacre being not yet concluded, <hi>the King</hi> with great ſhew of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>beſpeaks Coligni</hi> (thus). <q>You know, Father, (ſo he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him upon the account of his age and honour) what you undertook to me, that you would offer no injury, ſo long as you are at Court, to the Guiſes: and they again engaged, that they, as they ought, would behave themſelves toward you and yours honourably and modeſtly. I repoſe very great truſt in your words, but I have not the like confidence in their promiſes. For, beſides that I know the Guiſes do by all means ſeek revenge, I know their daring and haughty nature, and in what favour they are with the people of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. It would be a very great grief to me, if they who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of coming to the Marriage, have brought with them a great party of ſouldiers well appointed, ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing to your hurt; for that would be an injury to my ſelf: Therefore, if you think it expedient, I think it convenient, <hi>that the Regiment of the Guards be drawn into the City</hi> under theſe Commanders, (then he named thoſe who were no way ſuſpected), who, if any turbulent perſons at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing, may be ready at hand to ſecure the publick Peace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſuch friendly diſcourſe Coligni eaſily yielded his aſſent out of a deſire of domeſtick Peace, and being already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the Court-flatteries: therefore a Regiment is drawn within the walls, without any ſuſpition of the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. This being done, <hi>they enter into Counſel</hi>

                     <hi>again,</hi> and after ſome debate the thing was left undetermined, their opinions
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31919:10"/> varying according to the condition of places, and of the perſons admitted to the Council. For thus it was diſcourſed <hi>before the King,</hi> with whom were in Council the Queen-Mother, the Duke of Anjou, and others.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>There are <hi>two factions</hi> in the Kingdom; one of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morancies, to whom the Colignies were formerly added, but now upon the account of Religion, by which they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged many (to them), they conſtitute <hi>a new faction.</hi> The other is of the Guiſes: nor will France ever be quiet, or that Majeſty that is taken from Kings by the Civil Wars thence ariſing, ever be reſtored till the chief of their Heads who diſturb the moſt flouriſhing Empire, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, be ſtricken off. They, by the troubles of the Kingdom, have grown to ſo great Power, that they cannot be taken away at the ſame time: they are <hi>ſeverally to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken off, and ſet-one againſt the other,</hi> that they may deſtroy one another. Coligni muſt be begun with who only ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives of his Family, who being taken out of the way, it would much weaken the Momorancies, who lie under ſo great an odium upon the account of their joyning with Coligni. But this is an unworthy thing, and not to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by you, (ſaid they, directing their diſcourſe to the King), that a man whom only Nobility commends, one that is advanced to honour by the favour of Kings, now grown burdenſom to the Nobility, equal to Princes in honour, grievous to your ſelf, ſhould come to that height of madneſs and boldneſs, that he ſhould count it a ſport to mock at Royal Majeſty, and every day at his own luſt to raiſe Wars in the Kingdom. Certainly his madneſs is above all things by you, if you be indeed King, to be reſtrained, that by his example all may learn to bear their fortunes decently, and uſe them modeſtly. Nor only ſhall the faction of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morances be broken by his death, but the power of the Proteſtants ſhall be over-turned: of which, when he is the very heart and ſoul, in him alone the Proteſtants ſeem to live, and he being dead, they will fall with him. This is not only uſeful, but neceſſary for ſetling the publick Peace, when as experience doth ſhew, that as one houſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31919:11"/> keep two Dogs, nor one tree relieve two Parrots, ſo one and the ſame Kingdom cannot bear two Religions. This may be done without danger or blame, if ſome cut-throat, as there are enough of them to be had, be ſuborned to take away the life of Coligni, encouraged by ſome preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and hopes of future; who having done the thing, may make his eſcape by the help of a light horſe prepared for that purpoſe.<note place="margin">

But if the thing proceed not ſo far, yet at leaſt the blame of the fact, from which you ſhall receive great advantage, ſhall be tranſlated from you upon the Guiſians, (as bearing yet in memory the murder of their Father) whom, having deſtroyed their Rivals, you ſhall ſoon reduce into good order. This thing being done, you ſhall forthwith be able to determine concerning the chief leaders of the Proteſtants, whom you have in your power, who, no doubt, will return to their old Religion, and due allegiance to you when evil Counſellors ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.</q>

                  <p>And when it was debated in <hi>the Queens Council</hi> among thoſe that were to be truſted, their diſcourſe went further, that not only the Momorances with Coligni ſhould be taken off, but that the Guiſians ſhould at ſome fit opportunity be ſlain, as thoſe whom the Queen ought in no wiſe to truſt or ſpare, being heretofore grievouſly and often offended by her. For ſo the Counſellors ordered the matter, if the Proteſtants ſhould go about to revenge the death of Coligni, they and the Momorances ſhould in the conflict be oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the people, as being inferior in ſtrength, but not without great loſs to the adverſaries; whom the King having drawn a great number of Souldiers, which he had then at his command, into the Louvre, ſitting as a ſpectator, might at
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:31919:11"/> laſt ſet upon, being broken, and weakened by fighting, and as though they had taken Arms without his command, and by way of ſedition, might command them all to be ſlain together with the Nobles, as taking this or that party: for whiles they remained ſafe, there would be no end of murmurs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the Queen; whom the ſeditious cry out upon as a ſtranger, and ſo fit to be removed from the Government of the Kingdom.</p>

                     </note> and from that time often changing his lodgings, he concealed himſelf in the houſe of the Guiſes, in which Family he was brought up from a child. An houſe was alſo pitched upon in the Cloyſter of St. German Auxerrois, as they call it, the houſe of Peter Pila Villemur, who had formerly been Tutor to the Duke of Guiſe himſelf; by which Coligni returning home, muſt needs paſs.</p>
                  <p>Therefore upon the <hi>Friday, Coligni</hi> having diſpatched much buſineſs in the King's Council, where Anjou was preſent, and compoſed a difference between Antonius, Marafinus, Guer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius and Tiangius, chief of the Nobility of the Burgundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, forward men; he attended upon the King to the next Tennis-Court, from whence, after a promiſe from the King, the Duke of Guiſe and Teligny, betaking himſelf home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, walking on foot by the houſe of Villemur, going gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly along, and reading a Petition which was then by chance preſented to him, Morevel diſcharging a Muſquet from a window that had a linen Curtain drawn before it, he was <hi>ſhot with a brace of bullets,</hi> whereof one ſtruck off the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finger of his right-hand, and the other wounded him more
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31919:12"/> dangerouſly in his left-arm, while Guerchius was upon his right-hand, and Rochus, Sorbaeus, Prunaeus upon his left, who as likewiſe all that were there, were exceedingly aſtoniſhed at what was done.</p>
                  <p>But he with a countenance not diſturbed, only ſhewed them the houſe whence the bullets came, and preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands Armanus, Claromontius, Pilius, and Franciſcus Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinius, that they ſhould go the King, and in his name acquaint him with what was done: then binding up his arm, and leaning upon his domeſticks, he came on foot to his lodging, which was not far off: and when he was adviſed by one of his company that he ſhould ſee to it, whether the bullets wherewith he was wounded were not poiſoned, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that nothing ſhould befall him but what was ordered by God.</p>
                  <p>Forthwith they force the houſe whence the ſhot proceeded, and breaking open the dores, found the Muſquet in a lower room. A young maid and a page that were found there, were taken and bound; for Morevel at a back-dore getting upon his horſe, was already fled to St. Antony's Gate, where changing his horſe, and mounting another that was ready for that purpoſe, he made his eſcape.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. <hi>The King receiving the news,</hi> as if he had been aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at an unexpected accident, <q>Shall I never, ſaith he, be at quiet? and muſt new troubles alwaies ariſe from day to day?</q> and then throwing his rocket upon the ground, he withdrew into the inner Caſtle.

                  <p>Here all were full of wonder, and many were diſturbed, being troubled in their minds to think what thoſe things would come to. Many, even of thoſe who bare no great good will to Coligny, deteſted the fact. But <hi>Navar and Conde preſently repair to him,</hi> and when as in their preſence he was handled by the Chirurgions, he was heard amidſt all his pain to ſay (only) this. Is this the goodly reconciliation that the King did undertake for? then turning to Moore, Chaplain to the late Queen of Navar, he pronounced theſe words, <q>Ah my Brother, now I know I am beloved of God,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31919:12"/> for that I have received theſe wounds for his moſt holy Names ſake. God grant I may never forget his accuſtomed mercies towards me.</q> But when Ambroſius Paraeus the King's Chirurgeon told him that the Gangreen growing on, his finger muſt be cut off, and did attempt to do it with an inſtrument that had no good edge, though he was forced to open and ſhut the ſhears three times, yet he gave no ſign of ſenſe of his moſt ſharp pain: when he came to his left arm Merlin Conde's Chaplain came in, who when he began to comfort him out of the holy Scriptures, he brake out into theſe words; <q>My God, forſake me not in theſe troubles, nor ceaſe from thy accuſtomed mercies towards me.</q> Then he whiſpered in the ear to one who held up his arm, that he ſhould deliver to Merlin an hundred Aurei to be diſtributed to the poor of the Church of Paris: this I have often heard Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raeus ſpeak of, almoſt in the ſame words.</p>
                  <p>Thence <hi>Navar and Conde go to the King,</hi> and complain of the indignity of the fact; and ſince they and theirs could not be ſecure at Paris, they deſire leave to depart. Upon this the King aggravating the matter to the higheſt, and adding deeper oaths than before, promiſed that he would take ſuch revenge upon the Aſſaſine, the authors and abetters of this fact, as ſhould ſatisfy Coligny and his friends, and ſhould be an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to others for the future: that what was done was as great a grief to him as to any, but ſince what was done could not be undone, he would take the greateſt care that might be for a remedy, and would make all men underſtand that Coligny had the wound, but he had the ſmart: and that they might be eye-witneſſes of this thing, he deſires them that they would not depart out of Paris.</p>
                  <p>And he diſcourſing thus, Queen Katharine, who was then preſent, ſeconded, and ſaith, <q>The affront was offered to the King, not to Coligny; and if this villany ſhould not be puniſhed, it would ere long come to that paſs, that they would even dare to ſet upon the King himſelf in his houſe: therefore all means are to be uſed moſt ſharply to revenge ſo great a villany.</q> Theſe words being ſpoken with much heat, and ſeeming indignation, the minds of Navar and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31919:13"/> were ſomewhat appeaſed, who did not believe there was any diſſimulation, ſo that there was not a word more made of their departure out of the City.</p>
                  <p>Preſently <hi>ſome</hi> were <hi>ſent to purſue the Aſſaſine,</hi> though none as yet knew who he was. All the gates of the City are ſhut up till ſearch had been made, except two, by which proviſion was brought in, and even they were kept by a guard appointed by the King. In the mean while the maid and the boy that were taken in Villemur's houſe, who was then from home, were examined a-part by Chriſtopher Thuanus, and Bernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus Prevotius Morſanus, Preſidents of the Court, and James Viole a Senator: and the maid confeſſed that a few daies ſince Villerius Challius, a ſervant of the Guiſes, brought a Souldier to that houſe, and commended him to her, as it he had been the Maſter of the houſe, being a very near friend and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar acquaintance of his, and that therefore he made uſe, as long as he was there, of Villemur's Chamber and Bed; but what his name was he did induſtriouſly conceal. The boy who had ſerved the Aſſaſine but a few days, ſaid he was ſent by his Maſter, (who diſſembled his name, and called himſelf ſometimes Bolland, ſometimes Bondol the King's Archer) in the morning to Challius, to deſire him from him, that he would have the horſes in readineſs, which he promiſed him. From all which diſcoveries it was yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain who was the Aſſaſine: but when as they both agreed in Challius, it was given in charge to Gaspar Caſtraeus Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caeus, Captain of the King's Guard, that he ſhould ſeize him, and bring him forth to examination. Then Letters are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the Governors of the Provinces by the King, in which he deteſted the fact, and commanded that they ſhould make it their buſineſs that all might underſtand that it did highly grieve him, and that ere long there ſhould be given a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere example of ſo great a crime.</p>
                  <p>In the mean while <hi>d'Anville, Coſſaeus and Villarius</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals, <hi>viſiting Coligny</hi> about noon, ſaluted him in moſt friendly manner, and <hi>told him</hi> that that they did not come thither to exhort him to patience and fortitude: <q>For that, ſay they, theſe virtues are as it were natural to thee; thou haſt been
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:31919:13"/> wont to admoniſh others, and therefore wilt not be wanting to thy ſelf. <hi>He anſwering</hi> with a ſmiling countenance, ſaid, I ſpeak truly, and from my heart, death doth nothing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright me. I am ready moſt willingly to render to God that ſpirit which I have received from him, whenſoever he ſhall require it. But I do greatly deſire an opportunity to confer with the King before I depart this life; for I have ſome things to acquaint him with, which concern both him, and the ſafety and honour of the Kingdom, which I am well aſſured none of you dares carry to him.</q> Then d'Anville told him he would willingly acquaint the King with that (his deſire); and having ſo ſaid, he with Villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius and Teligny daparted, leaving Coſſaeus there, to whom Coligny ſaid, Do you remember what I ſaid to you a few hours ſince? be wiſe, and take heed to your ſelf. What he meant by theſe words was not underſtood by all.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. But when <hi>the King</hi> knew by d'Anville and Teligny his deſire, he in ſhew ſeemed not unwilling to <hi>come to him</hi> about the afternoon. There came together with him the Queen-Mother, with the Brethren, Anjou and Alanſon, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Borbon, Monpenſſer, Nevers, Coſſaeus and Tavanius, Villarius, Meruvius, Thoreus, Momorancies Brethren, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhals, Naucaeus and Radeſianus. Theſe being let in, the reſt are by the King's command ſhut out, except Teligny and a Gentleman of the Family, who ſtood at the Chamber-door; here it is publiſhed in writing, that ſome ſecrets were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the King by Coligny, but others deny it, and ſay that the diſcovery of this ſecret was purpoſely hindered by the Queen, left the King, whoſe nature ſhe began to diſtruſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mollified, and perſwaded by the word of Coligny, ſhould change his reſolution. That which was openly heard was this, when Coligny gave the King thanks, the King with a ſad and troubled countenance did earneſtly enquire of his ſtate, and did proteſt, that what had happened to him was a very great grief to him. <q>The wound is thine, ſaid he, but the pain is mine. But I ſwear (then according to his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he ſwore) I will ſo ſeverely revenge this injury, that the memory of it ſhall never be blotted out of the minds of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31919:14"/> men. To this <hi>Coligny anſwered,</hi> God is my witneſs, before whoſe tribunal I now ſeem (ready) to ſtand, that I have been all my life long moſt loyal and faithful to your Majeſty, and I always, and with all my heart, deſired that your Kingdom might be moſt flouriſhing and peaceable. And yet I am not ignorant that there have been ſome who have called me Traytor, and Rebel, and a perturber of our Kingdom; but I truſt, God will ſome time or other judg between me &amp; them, before whom I am ready, if it be his pleaſure that I ſhould at this time depart out of this life, to give an account of my faith and obſervance towards you. Moreover, whereas I have been advanced by Henry your Father to many and great honours which your Majeſty hath been pleaſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to me; I cannot but according to that faith and love that I have for your affairs, deſire that you would not let ſlip ſo notable an opportunity of an happy enterprize, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially now that the breach is already made, and there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tokens and pledges of your mind, as to the Belgick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition; ſo as if the matter now begun be relinquiſhed, it will be very dangerous to your Kingdom. Is it not a moſt unworthy thing that an egg cannot be moved in your Privy Council, but preſently almoſt before it be turned, a meſſenger runneth and reporteth it to the Duke of <hi>Alva?</hi> Is it not a moſt baſe thing that 300 either Gentlemen or gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant ſoldiers taken in Jenlis his fight, ſhould by the command of Alva either be hanged, or undergo ſome other kind of puniſhment? which thing I do yet perceive to be here in the Court a matter of jeſting and laughing. A third thing which I did deſire to diſcourſe with your Majeſty about, is the contempt of the Pacificatory Edict offered by thoſe that are in place of Juriſdiction, who do in moſt grievous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner daily violate the faith that was given by you; of which faith and oath even foreign Princes are witneſſes. But as I have often told your Majeſty and the Queen-Mother, I do not think there is any ſurer way of preſerving peace and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick tranquility, than by a religious and ſevere obſervance of the Edicts. But they are ſo contemned, that of late at Troyes there was an aſſault made upon the ſervants of the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31919:14"/> wife of the Prince of Conde: and when as ſhe, according to the form of your Edict, had choſen a certain Village cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Inſula, in which our Religion ſhould be exerciſed, yet notwithſtanding, of late, a certain man, and a nurſe, and an infant, that was brought to the holy font, were ſlain upon the way whiles they were returning from a Sermon that was made in that place.<note place="margin">Auguſt 10th.</note> And this happened a little before the 4th. Eid, 6 til.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this <hi>the King anſwered.</hi> 
                     <q>I eſteem thee, my Father, as I have often aſſured thee for a valiant and faithful perſon, and one that is moſt careful for my honour. Laſtly, I look upon thee as one of the chiefeſt and moſt valiant Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of my Kingdom; nor if I had any other opinion of thee, would I have done what I have for thee. As for the Edict which I lately iſſued out, I have always wiſhed, and do wiſh that it may be moſt diligently obſerved. And to that purpoſe I have taken care that ſome choice perſons ſhould be ſent through the Provinces, that may make this their bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; whom if thou doeſt ſuſpect, others ſhall be ſent in their places;</q> (for in diſcourſe he had ſaid he did ſuſpect them who had condemned him to death, and hanging, and ſet a price of fifty thouſand Aurei upon his head). Then, that he might break off this diſcourſe, he added, <q>I ſee, my Father, that you ſpeak earneſtly, and that earneſtneſs may hurt both you and your wounds. I will take care of this affair,</q> (and again, ſwearing by the name of God), <q>I do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you that I will moſt ſeverely revenge this injury upon the Authors of it, as if it were offered to my ſelf.</q> Then he, there is not need of any great ſearch for the Author of the fact, nor are the diſcoveries already made very doubtful. But it is enough, and upon that account, in the moſt humble man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that I can, I give your Majeſty thanks that you are plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed graciouſly to promiſe me to do me right.</p>
                  <p>Then the King taking aſide that Gentleman of the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold that ſtood at the dore, commanded him to ſhew him the bullet wherewith Coligny was wounded, and which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the wound, that he might look upon it. It was a brazen one: then he enquired of him, firſt, whether much
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31919:15"/> bloud flowed out of the wound; next, whether Coligny did ſignify the grievous pains he felt by out-cries and complaints. And having commended his conſtancy, and the greatneſs of his mind, he commanded that Gentleman that he ſhould not depart from him.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things paſſed for about the ſpace of an hour in the Chamber of Coligny: the King drawing out the time with wandring diſcourſes, and that he might put off the buſineſs of the Belgick War, to the mention of which, it is obſerved that he made no anſwer. Among theſe diſcourſes Radeſianus ſpoke to a friend of Coligny's concerning the removing him into the Caſtle of the Louvre for his greater ſecurity, if the people ſhould tumultuate; which thing the King himſelf did ſometime repeat, which almoſt all did interpret as an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the King's care of the health of Coligny. But when the Phyſitians, and chiefly Francis Mazilles the King's chief Phyſitian, anſwered there was danger, if his body ſhould be ſhaken in the carrying whiles his wounds were freſh, he would by no means be removed.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. After the King departed, <hi>the Nobles of the Proteſtant party take counſel together,</hi> and John of Ferriers Vidame of Chartres, in the preſence of Navar and Conde, conjecturing what was indeed the matter, ſaid that the Tragedy was begun by the wound of Coligny, but would end in the bloud of them all. Therefore he thought it moſt ſafe, that without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay they ſhould depart the City: he produced teſtimonies and tokens for his opinion from the rumors that were ſpread abroad; for it was heard by many, when upon the day of Marriage the Proteſtants went out of the Church that they might not engage in worſhip; the Papiſts ſaid, by way of mirth, that within a few days they ſhould hear Maſs. Alſo it was openly ſpoken in diſcourſe by the chief of the City, that at that Marriage ſhould be poured out more bloud than wine. That one of the Proteſtant Nobles was adviſed by the preſident of the Senate, that he ſhould with all his family betake himſelf for ſome days into the Country. Beſides theſe things, the counſel of Johannes Monlucius Biſhop of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence (when he was going Ambaſſador into Poland) given
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31919:15"/> to Roch-fou-cault, that he would not ſuffer himſelf to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated, and turned about by the ſmoke and unwonted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Court, which deſervedly ought to be ſuſpected by all wiſe and cautious perſons, that he would not be too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to run himſelf into danger, and that he would timely withdraw himſelf, together with other Nobles, from the Court. But Teligny being of another mind, and ſaying that he was abundantly ſatisfied of the ſincere love and good will of the King, Ferrerius, and thoſe that thought as he he did, could not be heard.</p>
                  <p>The next day <hi>the Page</hi> was <hi>again examined,</hi> and new wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes produced. In this examination Arnold Cavagnes was engaged, for ſo Coligny did deſire, and all things were done in ſhew, as if there had been a diligent enquiry into the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The next day, when as <hi>Coligny, and</hi> by his command <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naton</hi> in the name of his fellows (who, he ſaid, knew for certain that the Pariſians, that is LXM deadly enemies of Coligny would tumultuate, and take Arms), <hi>deſired</hi> of the King and his Brother Anjou, <hi>a guard</hi> of ſome Souldiers to be ſet <hi>to protect the houſe of Coligny,</hi> that if the people ſhould make any diſturbance, they might be reſtrained by fear of the King's guards, they both of them anſwered kindly and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and it was given in command to Coſſenius Colonel of the Regiment of the Guards, that with ſome choice Bands he ſhould keep watch before the dores of Coligny. To theſe were joyned, to avoid ſuſpition, ſome, but few in number, of the Switzers of the guards of Navar. Moreover, for the greater ſecurity, it was ordered by the King, that the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the Proteſtants who were in the City, ſhould lodge near Coligny's houſe, and it was given in command to Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-maſters forthwith to aſſign lodgings: and the King gave command with a loud voice, that all might hear it, to one of the Colonels, that no Catholick ſhould be ſuffered to come thither, nor ſhould they ſpare the life of any that ſhould do otherwiſe. Upon this occaſion the Corporals went from place to place, and wrote down the names of Proteſtants, and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31919:16"/> adviſed them to repair near to Coligny; for that the King would have it ſo.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and ſuch like ſigns and whiſperings abroad, though they had been enough to have warned the Proteſtants, if they had not been infatuated; yet by the conſtant diſſimulation of the King it came to paſs, that Coligny and Teligny could not perſwade themſelves that any ſuch cruelty was in his mind. Therefore when <hi>the Nobles entred into conſultation in the Chamber of Cornaton,</hi> in the houſe of Coligny, upon the ſame matter, and the Viſdame of Chartres perſevered in the ſame opinion, that they ſhould depart the City as ſoon as might be, and prevent that imminent danger, though with ſome diſadvantage to Coligny's health, who yet was that day ſomewhat better. Teligny was of opinion, and Navar and Conde agreed with him that they ſhould ſtay in the City, otherwiſe they ſhould offer a great affront to the King, that was ſo well affected towards them.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. There was a ſuſpition leſt this ſhould be caried to the King by one that was then preſent, that was Buchavanius Bajancu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, one very familiar with the Queen, who preſently haſted to the Tuilleries, where <hi>a Counſel</hi> was <hi>held by the Conſpirators</hi> under a colour of walking; there was <hi>the laſt time</hi> that they conſulted of the manner of executing the deſign. There were preſent beſides, <hi>the King, Queen,</hi> and <hi>Anjou,</hi> the Dukes of <hi>Nevers</hi> and <hi>Angoleſme,</hi> the Baſtard, <hi>Biragus, Tavannes</hi> and <hi>Radeſianus.</hi> 
                     <q>And ſince by the death of one man whom the Phyſitians did affirm was like to recover of his wound, the grievance of the Kingdom, which was nouriſhed by him, and diffuſed into many, could not be extinguiſhed, it ſeemed good that it ſhould be ſuppreſſed by the ruine of all; and that wrath which God would not have to be ſatisfied with the bloud of Coligny alone, ſhould be poured out upon all the Sectaries. That was their voluntary reſolution at firſt, and now by the event, neceſſity and force is put upon their counſels; that the danger that hangs over the King and the whole Kingdom, cannot be avoided without the ruine of Coligny and all the Proteſtants. For what would not he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31919:16"/> do ſo long as the faction of the Rebels remains entire after ſuch an injury? who, when he was no way provoked, was ſo long injurious to the King, and hurtful to the Kingdom? whom now all might foreſee, and dread, going out of Paris with his party, as a Lion out of his den, raging againſt all without reſpect. Therefore the reins are to be let looſe to the people, who are of themſelves ready enough, nor ought they any longer to withſtand the will of God, which would not that more mild Counſels ſhould take effect. After the thing is effected, there will not want reaſons whereby it may be excuſed, the fault being laid upon the Guiſians, which they would gladly take upon them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore all agreed upon the utter ruine of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants by a total ſlaughter. To which opinion the Queen was even by her own nature and proper deſign enclined; ſome time was ſpent in deliberating<note n="*" place="margin">The Duke of Guiſe was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to have the King of Navar and the Prince of Conde ſlain with the reſt. Dav. p. <hi>370.</hi> It was alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated whether among the reſt they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Marſhal d'An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, and his Brothers, who profeſſed the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but were nearly related to Coligny; but they were ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, becauſe the eldeſt Brother Marſhal Momo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rancy was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.

                     <hi>whether Navar and Conde ſhould be exempt</hi> from the number of the reſt; and as for <hi>Navar,</hi> all their ſuffrages agreed upon the account of his Royal Dignity, and the Affinity that he had lately contracted. For that fact which of it ſelf could not but be blamed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, would be ſo much the more blamed, if a great Prince near of Bloud to the King, joyned in a very late affinity, ſhould be ſlain in the King's Palace, in the arms as it were of the King his Brother-in-law, and in the embraces of his Wife. For there would be no ſufficient excuſe, nor would thoſe argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prevail to excuſe the King, which might caſt the blame upon the Guiſians. Concerning <hi>Conde</hi> there was a greater debate, he lying under the load of his Fathers faults: yet both the dignity of the man, and the authority of Ludovicus Gonzaga Duke of Nevers, affirming that he would be loyal and obedient to the King, and alſo offering himſelf as a ſurety for him, upon the account of that cloſe and manifold relation that was between them; (for Conde had lately married Mary of Cleve the Siſter of Henrica Wife of the Duke of Nevers), did prevail that he ſhould be ſpared, and exempt from the number of thoſe that were deſigned for the ſlaughter, as well as Navar.</p>
                  <p n="15">15. Upon this the Duke of <hi>Anjou and Engoleſme</hi> the Baſtard
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31919:17"/> departing, as they rode in their Coach through the City, they <hi>ſpread abroad a rumor</hi> as if the King had ſent for Momorancy, and was about to bring him into the City with a ſelect num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of horſe.</p>
                  <p>The very ſame hour there was <hi>one apprehended who was ſuſpected of the hurt of Coligny,</hi> who confeſſed himſelf to be a ſervant of the Guiſes; which, when it was underſtood, <hi>Guiſe and Aumale,</hi> and others of the Family went to the King to remove that ſuſpition; and <hi>complain</hi> that they were oppreſſed through the favour that was ſhewed to their enemies: that the ears of Judges were open to calumnies caſt upon them, and that tho they were guiltleſs, yet they were manifeſtly ſet againſt: that they had a long time obſerved that they were, for what cauſe they knew not, every day leſs gracious with the King: but yet that they did diſſemble it, and hoped that time, which is the beſt Maſter of truth, would at laſt inform him more certainly of the whole matter. But ſince they find no place for their innocence, they did, though unwillingly, and as forced to it, <hi>deſire</hi> that with his good leave <hi>they might return home.</hi> This was done openly, and it was obſerved that the King anſwered to theſe things ſomewhat coldly, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he might perſwade the Proteſtants that he bare no good will to the Guiſians.</p>
                  <p>Upon this <hi>the King adviſeth Navar</hi> that he ſhould afford no occaſion of miſchief to the audacity and violentneſs of the Guiſians, things being ſo enflamed, and the people enclining to the Guiſian party. That he ſhould command thoſe whom he knew moſt faithful of his ſervants to come into the Louvre, to be ready upon any ſudden accident; which Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var did, interpreting it in good part, calling thoſe which were moſt active to lodge with him that night in the Louvre Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>Wiſe men alſo did <hi>preſage ſome future commotions,</hi> when they obſerved <hi>armed men</hi> to run up and down about the City and the Louvre, the people to mutter, <hi>threatnings</hi> to be every where heard. This being brought to <hi>Coligny,</hi> he who no way doubted of the good will of the King, but thought it to be the deviſe of the Guiſians to enflame the people, <hi>ſends one
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31919:17"/> to the King,</hi> who ſhould in his name acquaint him with it. To whom the King anſwered, that Coligny need fear nothing: for thoſe things were done by his command, to compoſe the tumults of the people that were ſtirred up by the Guiſians. Therefore, that his mind might be ſecure,</p>
                  <p>It was alſo told Teligny the very ſame hour, that <hi>Porters laden with Arms</hi> were ſeen to be brought into the Louvre: but he contemned the meſſage, and anſwered, that unneceſſary ſuſpitions were ſought for in this ſad and diſmal time, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad that this ſhould be made known to Coligny, affecting the unſeaſonable reputation of prudence and moderation, from his deſpiſing of reports, and conſequently of dangers: and excuſing the matter, as if thoſe Arms were carried into the Louvre upon the account of a Caſtle repreſented and aſſaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Forthwith <hi>Guiſe,</hi> to whom the chief command of the execution of the whole matter was committed, <hi>calling together</hi> in the deep of night <hi>ſome Captains</hi> of the Switzers, and the Captains of the French Troops, <hi>explains to them the Kings will and pleaſure.</hi> 
                     <q>That the time was come wherein, by the King's command, puniſhment ſhould be taken upon that head that was ſo hateful both to God and men, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo upon the whole faction of the Rebels: that the beaſt was now in their toils: that they ſhould take care that he eſcape not: that they ſhould not be wanting to ſuch an opportune occaſion, of obtaining a more glorious triumph than they ever yet obtained in all their former Wars, with the bloud of ſo many Royalliſts: that the Victory was eaſy: that rich ſpoils are propoſed, which they might acquire without bloud, as rewards of their good ſervice.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon this <hi>the Switzers are placed about the Louvre,</hi> to whom are joyned the French Troops, and command was given that they ſhould look to it, that no man of the Family of Navar or Conde ſhould go out of the Louvre.

                  <p>Matters being ſo diſpoſed as to the foreign Souldiers, the Duke of <hi>Guiſe calls to him, John Charron,</hi> Preſident of the Court of Revenues, (who, after a long canvaſing, and often repulſes, was at laſt put into that Office in the place of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus Provoſt of the Merchants), and commands him that he ſhould give notice to the Corporals <hi>to command their Souldiers to their Arms,</hi> but that they ſhould remain at the Town-Hall till midnight, there to underſtand what was needful to be done.</p>
                  <p>The ſame thing was given in <hi>command to Marcellus,</hi> who though he was diſcharged of his office, yet for ſome private good offices that he had done, was retained in the Queens fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and kept his authority, though he loſt his dignity. He by often going to the Court, brought himſelf into an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with men, that he was in favour with the King and Queen; and upon that account was acceptable to the people, and from his mouth the people, that were of themſelves apt enough to ſtirs, were certified, <q>That it was the King's plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that they ſhould take Arms to cut off Coligny and the other Rebels; that therefore they ſhould ſee to it that none were ſpared, nor that thoſe wicked men ſhould be any where concealed. So the King will have it, ſo he commands, who alſo will provide that other Cities of the Kingdom do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follow the example of the Pariſians. <hi>The ſign</hi> at which they ſhould riſe, is the tolling of the bell of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace-clock. <hi>The Mark</hi> whereby they ſhould be diſtinguiſhed from others, is white linen-cloath bound about their left arm, and a white croſs in their hats. That good ſtore of them ſhould therefore be ready with arms and good courage, and take care that candles be lighted in their windows throughout all their houſes: that no ſtir or tumult ariſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſign given.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The commands and admonitions of Marcellus are readily received by the Corporals, Colonels, Captains and Wardſmen of the City, who put themſelves into a poſture with the greateſt ſilence that the ſudden ſtate of things would permit; ſetting their Guards in the ſtreets and paſſages, but at firſt within dores.

When he was about to be thrown into the River by the boys, from thence he was drawn to the Gibbet of Mount Faucon, where, with his legs upward, and his body down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, he is hanged in iron-chains: then a fire is made under him, by which he is only ſcorched, not conſumed; that he might as it were be tormented through all the Elements, ſlain upon the earth, drowned in the water, burnt in the fire, and hanged in the air. There when (his corps) had been expoſed for ſome days to the luſt and rage of all ſpectators, and to the juſt indignation of many, who did boad that that rage would hereafter coſt the King and all France dearly, Francis Momorancy, who had timely withdrawn himſelf from the danger, being near of kin, and nearer by friendſhip to the dead, took care that he ſhould by ſome truſty men be taken down by might, and committed to the earth in a Chapel at Chantilly.</p>

Being raiſed by the King to great honours, of which he carried himſelf worthy, as Colonel of the King's Life-guard, and Governour of Bearne, he ſeems to be preſerved from that danger by the ſingular Grace of God, that he might by his numerous off ſpring which he had by his Wife, propagate that Family that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to a few, and by his virtue add the higheſt ornament to the honours of his Anceſtors.</p>

                     <hi>Stephanus Cevalerius Pruneus,</hi> the King's Treaſurer in Poictou, a man of great integrity, and one that was very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous for the good of the Common-weal, who had been the principal mover for the building the Stone-bridge of Vienne, laid at Eraldi-caſtrum, was by certain cut-throats ſent by <hi>Stephanus Fergo Petauderius,</hi> (who ſought after his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer-ſhip), after the payment of a great ſum of mony, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly

Nor did they ſpare <hi>thoſe whom Navar</hi> (being adviſed ſo to do by the King) <hi>had brought into the Palace:</hi> for they were by the King's command made to come down from their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters chambers into the Court-yard, and being brought out of the Palace, their ſwords being taken from them, they were many of them preſently ſlain at the Gate; others were hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſlaughter without the Palace. Among theſe were <hi>Pardallanius, Sammartinus, Burſius</hi> and <hi>Armannus, Claromon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Pilius,</hi> famous for his late valour in defending the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. John. He, when he was led out to be butchered, ſtanding before the heaps of the ſlain, is ſaid to cry out, <q>Is this the King's faith? Are theſe his promiſes? Is this the peace? But thou, O moſt great and moſt good God, behold the cauſe of the oppreſſed, and as a juſt Judge avenge this perfidy and cruelty:</q> and putting off his Coat which was very rich, gave it to a certain Gentleman of his acquaintance that ſtood by; Take this from me as a remembrance of my unworthy death: which gift he not accepting under that condition, whiles Pilius ſaid theſe things, he was thruſt into the ſide with a ſpear, of which wound he fell down and died.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Leiranus</hi> now grievouſly wounded, but eſcaping out of the hands of the murderers, ruſhing into the Queen of of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vars chamber, and hiding himſelf under her bed, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; and being carefully commended by Margaret to the King's Phyſitians, was healed. Bellonarius formerly Tutor to the King of Navar, having a long time lien under the Gout, was ſlain in his bed.</p>
                  <p>The King received to his grace <hi>Grammontanus</hi> Lord of Gaſcoign, <hi>Johannes Durforlius Duralius, Joachimus Roaldus Gamarius,</hi> and <hi>Buchavarius,</hi> having promiſed to be faithful to him: and they were worth their word.</p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:31919:23"/>
                  <p>Then <hi>the King calls Navar and Conde,</hi> and tells them, that from his youth, for many years, the publick peace had been diſturbed by often renewed wars, to the great damage of his affairs; but now, at laſt, by the grace of God, he had entred into ſuch a courſe as would extirpate all cauſes of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture wars. That Coligny, the author of theſe troubles, was ſlain by his command, and that the ſame puniſhment was taken, throughout the City, upon thoſe wicked men who were infected with the poiſon of ſuperſtition: That he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred what great miſchiefs had befallen him from them, Navar and Conde, who had headed a company of profligate perſons, and ſeditiouſly raiſed war againſt him. That he had juſt reaſon to revenge theſe injuries, and now alſo had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity put into his hand; but that he would pardon what was paſt upon the account of their conſanguinity, and the lately contracted affinity, and laſtly of their age: and that he would think that theſe things were not done by the advice or fault of them, but of Coligny and his followers, who had already, or ſhould ſhortly receive the juſt deſerts of their wickedneſs: that he was willing that thoſe things ſhould be buried in oblivion, provided they would make amends for their former offences, by their future loyalty and obedience; and renouncing their profane ſuperſtitious Doctrine, would return to the Religion of their Anceſtors, that is, to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick Religion: for he would have only that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion profeſſed in his Kingdom which he had received from his fore-Fathers. Therefore, that they ſhould look to it that they do comply with him herein, otherwiſe they might know that the ſame puniſhment which others had ſuffered, did hang over their heads.</p>
                  <p>To this the King of <hi>Navar</hi> did moſt humbly beg, that no violence might be offered to their conſciences nor perſons, and that then they would remain faithful to him, and were ready to ſatisfy him in all things. But <hi>Conde</hi> added, that he could not perſwade himſelf that the King, who had engaged himſelf by ſolemn oath to all the Proteſtant Princes of his Kingdom, would upon any account violate it, or hearken to their enemies and adverſaries in that matter. As to Religion,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:31919:24"/> that was not to be commanded, that his life and fortunes were in the King's power to do with them what he pleaſed; but that he knew he was to give an account only to God of that Religion that he had received from God. Therefore that he was fixed and reſolved never to recede from his Religion, which he knew aſſuredly was true, no, not for any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent danger of life. With which anſwer the King being highly provoked, he called Conde ſtubborn, ſeditious, Rebel, and the ſon of a Rebel, and told him, that if he did not change his mind within three days, his head ſhould pay for his obſtinacy.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. Many of the Proteſtant Nobles had taken up their lodgings in <hi>the Suburbs of St. German,</hi> and could not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to lie in the City. Among theſe were <hi>Johannes Roanus Frontenaeus, Godofridus Caumonlius, Vidame of Chartres, Gabriel Mongomerius, Jo. Lafinius, Bellovarius, Segurius Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dallanius,</hi> and others. The deſtroying of whom was given in charge to <hi>Laurentius Maugironus:</hi> and beſides Marcells was ordered to take care that 1000 Souldiers of the City Trained-Bands ſhould be ſent thither to Maugironus, who went but ſlowly on in his buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>While this was doing, tidings came to <hi>Mongomery</hi> of the rumor of taking up Arms in the City, who ſignified the ſame to the <hi>Vidame of Chartres,</hi> and preſently they met all together, uncertain what was to be done; for that many confiding in the King's faithfulneſs, perſwaded themſelves that this was done without the King's command, by the Guiſians, encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the forwardneſs of the ſeditious people, therefore they thought it was beſt to go to the King, and that he would ſuccour them againſt any violence.</p>
                  <p>In that doubtfulneſs of mind (though the more prudent did not doubt that theſe things were done by agreement, and by the King's command) were many hours ſpent, ſo that they might eaſily have been deſtroyed, but that another impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment happened to the Conſpirators; for whiles Maugironus doth in vain expect Pariſians to be ſent from Guiſe, who were all buſied in plundering, Guiſe impatient of further delays, calls forth the King's Guards out of the Louvre, intending
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:31919:24"/> whiles they paſſed the River to go thither himſelfe. And when he came to the gates, it did too late appear that they had miſtaken the keys, therefore while they ſent for others, it being now broad day, the Switzers and others of the King's Guards paſſing the Siene, were ſeen from the other ſide: and upon the diſcharging of a Gun on the other ſide of the River, as was thought by the King's command, the Aſſociates take counſel to fly and before they came, were gotten a good way off. Guiſe purſued Mongomery and others to Montfort, but in vain, and meeting with <hi>Sanleodegarius,</hi> he commands him that he ſhould follow them with freſh horſes. There were ſome ſent to Udencum, and to Dreux, who ſhould intercept them if they went that way: but all in vain.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Franciſcus Bricomotius,</hi> who could not be deſtroyed in the tumult, flies to the Engliſh Ambaſſadors lodgings,<note n="†" place="margin">In Bernardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum caio.</note> where he for ſome days lay hid. <hi>Arnoldus Cavagnius</hi> alſo hid himſelf not far from hence, with a friend, who fearing the danger, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to provide for himſelf; but both being taken, were caſt into the Palace priſon, and with that event which we ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time Guiſe, with Aumale and Angoleſme, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the City, where the King's Guards did commit out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages upon the lives and fortunes of the Proteſtant Nobles and Gentlemen, even of thoſe that were their familiars, and well known to them. This work being aſſigned to them in particular, whiles the people incited by the Sheriffs wardſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and tything-men that ran about, did furiouſly rage with all manner of licentiouſneſs and exceſs againſt their fellow-Citizens, and <hi>a ſad and horrid face of things</hi> did every where appear. For the ſtreets and ways did reſound with the noiſe of thoſe that flocked to the ſlaughter and plunder, and the complaints and doleful out-cries of dying men, and thoſe that were nigh to danger were every where heard. The carkaſſes of the ſlain were thrown down from the windows, the Courts &amp; chambers of houſes were full of dead men, their dead bodies rolled in dirt were dragged through the ſtreets, bloud did flow in ſuch abundance through the chanels of the ſtreets, that full

                     <hi>ſtreams of bloud</hi> did run down into the River: the number of the ſlain, men, women, even thoſe that were great with child, and children alſo, was innumerable.</p>

                     <hi>Annas Terrerius Chapius,</hi> being eighty years old, and an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of great name in the Senate, was ſlain. Alſo <hi>Jo.

Which thing, when it came to the hearing of <hi>Dionyſius Lambinus,</hi> Monſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienſis, King's profeſſor of humanity, and of both Languages, and who, by many books that he had publiſhed, deſerved well of Learning, and he was otherwiſe no friend to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Doctrine, yet was he ſo affrighted at the example of Ramus, that he could not be comforted, and it made ſo deep an impreſſion upon his mind, that he fell into a moſt grievous diſeaſe, of which about a month after he died.</p>
                  <p>From their contentions the name of <hi>Politick</hi> took its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which afterwards became a note of faction, being given by the ſeditious, by thoſe that favoured the King's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the peace of the Kingdom.</p>

And James Carpenter alluding to the Month, in a writing that he publiſhed, called that light <hi>Auguſto.</hi> Therefore the ſeditious flocking together at the ſame of the bloſſoming thorn, did skip about with great joy: which they alſo teſtified by the unuſual beating of a Drum, though without command, (for even that they might do then) and ſo interpreted it, as if the Proteſtants being rooted out, the Catholick Religion, and the Kingdom of France ſhould recover its ancient ſplendor and flower. But the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants argued otherwiſe; and if this were to be looked upon as a Miracle, they ſaid this was portended by this ſign; that though the Church might ſeem by this wound to be utterly extinct, yet it ſhould come to paſs that it ſhould in a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and incomprehenſible manner revive and flouriſh; which alſo they did confirm by the example of the wonder ſhewed to Moſes in the buſh, which, though it burned, yet was it not conſumed. They added, that it might be ſaid rather to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the commendation of innocence, than the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of butchery, becauſe the thorn bloſſomed in a place which took its name from Innocents.</p>
                  <p>The ſame day ſome drawn out of the King's Life Guard by Gaſper Caſtreus Nanoaeus, are by the King's command ſent to<note n="†" place="margin">Caſtillionem ad Lupam.</note> Chaſtillon, to take and bring <hi>Coligny to wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> as alſo the ſons of Andoletus. But Franciſcus the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Son of Coligny, and Vidus Lavallus the Eldeſt Son of Andoletus, had already ſaved themſelves by flight. All the reſt are taken, and brought with all their precious houſhold-ſtuff to Paris.</p>
                  <p n="25">25. It was <hi>the King's deſign,</hi> that as ſoon as the ſlaughter of Coligny and his followers had been performed, the Guiſes ſhould immediately depart the City, and go every one to his own houſe, that thereby all might take notice, that whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had been done at Paris proceeded from their faction. But the Queen and Anjou eſpecially (who did both of them with an over weaning affection incline to the party of Guiſe) did intercede: (ſeeing) the King was at firſt enraged only
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:31919:28"/> againſt Coligny, as not yet forgetting his flight from Meaux, drew him on, who yet wavered, to the ſlaughter of all the Proteſtants in the City; ſo that not knowing where he ſet his foot, they brought him by degrees to this paſs, that he ſhould take the whole blame upon himſelf, and ſo eaſe the Guiſians, who were not able to bear ſuch a burden. And to that end Anjou did, as it it was laid, produce Letters found in Teligny's desk, written by the hand of Momorancy, in which, after the wound given to Coligny, he did affirm that he would revenge this injury upon the Authors of it, who were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known with the ſame mind as if it had been offered to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon the Queen and Anjou took occaſion to ſhew the King, <q>That if he perſiſted in his former diſſimulation, things were come to that paſs, that he would endanger the ſecurity of the Kingdom, his Fortunes, Riches, and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. For the Guiſians, who do by theſe Letters, and otherwiſe, underſtand the mind of the Momorancies, being men deſirous of troubles, and ſeeking grounds of them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion, will never lay down their Arms which they have by the King's command taken up, to offer this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: that they will ſtill keep them under pretence of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending their ſafety, which they ſay is aimed at by the enemy; and ſo that which was thought to have been the end of a moſt bloudy war, will prove to be the beginning of a more dangerous one. For the remainders of the Proteſtants, who ſee their matters diſtreſſed, will, without doubt, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther themſelves to the Momorancies, who are of themſelves ſtrong, and thence will take new ſtrength and ſpirits: which if it ſhould happen, what a face of the Kingdom will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, when the name and authority of the King's Majeſty being ſlighted and trampled upon, every one ſhall take liberty to himſelf, and indulge to private hatred and affections accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own luſt? Laſtly, what will foreign Princes think of the King, who ſuffers himſelf to be over-ruled by his ſubjects, who cannot keep his ſubject in their duty, and laſtly, who knows not how to hold the reins of legal power?
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:31919:29"/> Therefore there is no other way to prevent ſo great an evil, but for the King to approve by his publick Proclamation, of what was done, as if it had been done by his command. For by this means he ſhould take the arbitrement and power to himſelf; and on the one hand diſarm the Guiſes, and on the other hand keep the Momorancies from taking up Arms; and laſtly ſhould bring it about, that the Proteſtant affairs now already very low, ſhould be ſeparated from the cauſe of the Momorancies. That the King ought not to fear the odium of the thing: for there is not ſo much danger in the horridneſs of a fact, (the odium whereof may be ſomewhat allayed by excuſe), as in the confeſſion of weakneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, which doth neceſſarily bring along with it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, which is almoſt deſtructive to Princes.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By theſe reaſons they eaſily perſwaded, an imperious Prince, who leſs feared hatred than contempt that he might recall the Guiſians to obedience, and retain the Momorancies in their loyalty, to confirm by publick teſtimony, that whatſoever had been done, was done by his will and command. Therefore in the morning, viz. upon the Tueſday, he <hi>came into the Senate</hi> with his Brethren, the King of Navar, and a great retinue of Nobles, after they had heard Maſs with great ſolemnity, and ſitting down in the Chair of State, all the orders of the Court being called together, <q>He complained of the grievous injuries that he had from a child received from Gaſpar Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny, and wicked men falſly pretending the name of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: but that he had forgiven them by Edicts made for the publick Peace. That Coligny, that he might leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be added to his wickedneſs, had entred into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy how to take away him, his mother, his brethren, and the King of Navar himſelf, though of his own Religion, that he might make young Conde King<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whom he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined afterwards to ſlay likewiſe, that the Royal Family being extinct, he uſurping the Kingdom, might make him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King. That he, when it could not otherwiſe be, did, though full ſore againſt his will, extinguiſh one miſchief by another, and as in extream dangers, did uſe extream reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:31919:29"/> that he might extirpate that impure contagion out of the bowels of the Kingdom. Therefore, that all ſhould take notice, that whatſoever had been that day done by way of puniſhment upon thoſe perſons, had been done by his ſpecial command.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he had ſaid theſe things, <hi>Chriſtophorus Thuanus,</hi> chief Preſident, in a ſpeech fitted to the time, commended the King's prudence, who, by diſſembling ſo many injuries, had timely prevented the wicked conſpiracy, and the danger that was threatned by it, and that that being ſuppreſſed, he had now ſetled peace in the Kingdom, having well learnt that ſaying of Lewis XI. He that knows not how to diſſemble, knows not how to reign.</p>
                  <p>Then the Court was commanded that diligent enquiry ſhould be made concerning the conſpiracy of Coligny and his Aſſociates, and that they ſhould give ſentence according to form of Law, as the heinouſneſs of the fact did require. Then laſtly <hi>Vidus Faber Pibraccius,</hi> Advocate of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry (or Attorney-General) ſtood up, and asked the King whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he did will and command that this declaration ſhould be entred into the acts of the Court, to the preſervation of the memory of it? whether the orders of Judges and Civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, which he had complained were corrupted, ſhould be reformed? And laſtly, whether by his command there ſhould be an end put to the ſlaughters and rapines? To theſe things the King anſwered, that he did command the firſt; that he would take care about the ſecond, and that for the third he did give command by publick proclamation through all the ſtreets of the City, that they ſhould for the future ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from all ſlaughters and rapines. Which declaration of the King aſtoniſhed many, and among the reſt <hi>Thuanus</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was a man of a merciful nature, and altogether averſe from bloud, and feared that example, and the danger that was threatned thereby: who alſo did with great freedom privately reprove the King, for that, if the conſpiracy of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny and his company had been true, he did not rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt them by Law.

                  <p>The adviſing of the King to enquire into this conſpiracy, is thought to have been from <hi>James Morvillerius</hi> Biſhop of Orleans, who had left his Biſhoprick to give himſelf wholly to the Court: a man of a cautious nature, but moderate and juſt, and who was never the author of that bloudy counſel. But when as that which was done could not be undone, he thought it was beſt for the reputation of the King, and for the publick Peace, that ſince the odium of it could not be wholly aboliſhed, yet that it might by ſome means be mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he perſwaded the King and Queen, that to the things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now done, they ſhould, though in a prepoſterous manner, apply the authority of Law; and that proof being made of the conſpiracy, judgment ſhould be paſſed upon the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors in form of Law; which thing Thuanus himſelf appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, being conſulted about it by Morvillerius upon the King's command.</p>
                  <p>Two days after <hi>a Jubilee</hi> is appointed, and Prayers are made by the King, and a full Court in a great aſſembly of people, and thanks were returned to God, for that things had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo happily, and according to their deſires.

Therefore,

                  <p n="26">26. Theſe Edicts and Mandates were diverſly entertained <hi>in the Provinces,</hi> according to the divers natures and factions of the Governors; for thoſe that were addicted to the party of the Momorancies, made a moderate uſe of them, but great was the rage and fury of others to whom ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were brought, not in writing, but by Emiſſaries, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example of the Pariſian Maſſacre.</p>
                  <p>The beginning was <hi>at Meaux,</hi> as being neareſt, where the ſame day that the Maſſacre had been at Paris, above two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were thrown into priſon by <hi>Coſſetus</hi> Advocate of the Treaſury, an impudent man, who was chiefly aſſiſted by <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Rollandus</hi> an Apparitor, and <hi>Columbus</hi> a Mariner.

                  <p>But great was the rage at <hi>Orleans,</hi> which being once or twice taken by the Proteſtants, the ſad ruines of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed Churches lying open to the eyes of all, did enkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the minds of the people to revenge their injuries, being yet freſh: the day following therefore they began upon <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellus Bovillus,</hi> one of the King's Counſellors, whom being ignorant of what had happened at Paris, Curtius a Weaver, the leader of the ſeditious, with ſome of his party, went as it were to viſit in the evening; he thinking that they come as friends to ſup with him, entertained them as at a feaſt; which (entertainment) the murderers having received, they acquaint him with what was done at Paris, and withal demand his Purſe, which being delivered, they in the midſt of their entertainment ſtay their <hi>Hoſt.</hi> From thence as if this had been the ſign given, they flock together for three days to murder and ſpoil; above 1000 men, women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as it was thought, were ſlain, part were caſt into the river Loire: thoſe that were ſlain without the City were thrown into the ditch.

The ring-leader and chief promoter of this was one <hi>Boidonus,</hi> a wicked debauched fellow, who afterward came to his deſerved end, being executed at Claremont in Auvergne.

They poor wretches coming out of their hiding places, as if they had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into the King's protection, came to him, and by his command were committed to ſeveral priſons; for the King's priſons upon the River Rhone were not able to receive ſuch a multitude.<note place="margin">Rodanenſes Regii.</note> Upon this, <hi>Petrus Antiſſiodorenſis</hi> Chamberlain of the City, a man wicked and infamous for diſhoneſt luſts, rode poſt, and without letters, as if the dignity of the man had carried authority enough with him, affirms to Mandelotus, that this was the Kings and Queens will and pleaſure, that the Proteſtants that were taken, or could be taken, ſhould be

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:31919:33"/> one another to conſtancy, they were ſlain like ſheep by merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Butchers, Porters, Water-men, among the ſad lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and horrid cries that did reſound all over the City. Which thing Mandelotus in all haſte returning from Guilloteria, but yet after the thing was done, ſeemed to be much troubled at, as if it had been done without his conſent or privity, and coming to the place of the Maſſacre, taking the King's Officer along with him, that he might enquire into the matter in a legal way, and proofs being taken by a publick Notary, in a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous diſſimulation, he commanded Proclamation to be made, that thoſe that knew who were the Authors of this outrage, ſhould tell their names, an hundred Crowns being propoſed to the informer and diſcoverer for his reward. In the evening the ſame Butchers went to the publick priſon, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Rhone, and raged againſt the priſoners with a new ſort of cruelty; and miſerably tormented them with halters put about their necks, and dragged them half dead into the River that was near. The night following is ſpent in ſlaughters and plundering; houſhold-ſtuff is carried out of houſes, and wares out of ſhops: thoſe that hid themſelves are by ſpies brought out of their hiding places, and many thrown into the River. Mandelotus being offended at the horror of the ſight of the bodies of the ſlain lying in the Court of the Arch-Biſhop's houſe, commanded them to be put into boats, and carried to the other ſide of the River, that they might be buried in the Church-yard of the Monaſtery of Aiſnay, where was formerly the Altar of Lions, and ſent men thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee them buried. But the Monks ſaid they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer that, and that thoſe carkaſſes were unworthy of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial. Therefore, upon a ſign given, there is a concourſe made, and they are thrown by the enraged people into the River; the groſſer bodies being given to the Apothecaries, upon their deſir, for their fat, as is reported by thoſe who wrote whiles things were freſh. Nor did the ſlaughter ſtay here, For not long after the (two) Brothers, <hi>Darutii,</hi> Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of great account, <hi>Labeſſaeus, Galterus,</hi> and <hi>Floccardus,</hi> honourable Citizens, being brought out of the priſon, had their throats cut, and were caſt into the River Rhone.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:31919:33"/> Among theſe ſlaughters ſome <hi>eſcaped</hi> by the help of the guards, and the favour of Manta the Governor, among whom were <hi>Jo. Ricaldus,</hi> and <hi>Antonius Callia,</hi> Paſtors of the City, when as <hi>Joannes Anglus,</hi> chief Paſtor, was ſlain in the firſt tumult, it is ſaid that 800 of all kinds and ſexes were bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barouſly ſlain: the carkaſſes of the ſlain ſwimming down Rhone to Turnonium, lay ſo thick about the banks, that the Townſmen affrighted at the accident, cried Arm, Arm, as if the enemy had been coming upon them: by and by being amazed with horror, and deteſting the authors of ſuch a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany, though they had no favour for the Religion of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, to remove that ſad ſpectacle, they ſet men to thruſt the bodies off with poles from the banks, which the ſwift ſtream brought down. So horrid a ſpectacle they alſo deteſted at Vienne, at Valence, at Burgh, at Viviers, at the Temple of the Spirit, yea, at Avenion, where there is great hatred of the Proteſtants. But at Arles, when through want of wells and ſprings they drink of the water, of the River; the Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, beſides the deteſtableneſs of the villany, were grievouſly diſtreſſed; when as they would not uſe the fiſhes and water that they could be ſupplied with only from Rhone; yea, they abhorred the very ſight of the River.</p>
                  <p n="28">28. But in Dauphine and <hi>Provence</hi> things were carried af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter far another manner. For <hi>Claudius Sabaudus Count of Tende,</hi> who was very nearly allied to the Momorancies, when Letters were brought him about the ſame buſineſs by <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus Bonifacius Mola,</hi> who two years after came to an <note n="†" place="margin">Being execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and his quarters ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the City<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates.</note> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy end at Paris, ingenuouſly anſwered that he did not think that that was the King's pleaſure, but that ſome that were evilly affected to the publick Peace, did falſly pretend his name, when as not many days ſince he had received quite other commands: that therefore he would rather obey the former, as more worthy of the King's Faith and Clemency. But he not long after being at Avignon, died of a ſudden diſeaſe, to the great grief of the people of Provence, not without ſuſpition given him by the Emiſſaries of the ſeditious.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Dauphine, Bertrandus Simienus Gordius,</hi> educated in the Family of the Momorancies, receiving the ſame command,

                  <p>Alſo <hi>Santeranus</hi> Governor of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> who alſo was well affected to the Momorancies, uſed the ſame moderation, and made the ſame anſwer to thoſe that came poſting to him from Court, that the Count of Tende had done before him, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this moreover, that he would never obey ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, unleſs the King in perſon did command him.</p>

Two days after, by authority of the Senate, publick Proclamation was made, that no violence or moleſtation ſhould be offered to the Proteſtants. The day following, Guards being ſet at the Gates of the City, and in the Streets, thoſe that were ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted are ſome of them diſtributed into Monaſteries, others are caſt into the common priſons; ſome days after, upon the coming from Court of <hi>Delpechius</hi> and <hi>Madronius,</hi> rich Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, and moſt bitter enemies to the Proteſtants, they were all thrown into the Palace priſon, where preſently in the night, by certain cut-throats choſen out of the Students of the Civil Law, that went to the Fencing-School, (among whom one <hi>Turrius</hi> was moſt eminent), together with other men of lewd life and converſation, 200 were barbarouſly ſlain, and among them ſome Senators, and in the firſt place

                  <p>At the ſame time, but with greater ſlaughter, were things carried at <hi>Rouen,</hi> where <hi>Tanaquilius Venator Carrugius,</hi> the Governor of the chief Nobility of Provence, a man of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful diſpoſition, did what he could to hinder it. But at laſt, not being able any longer to withſtand the violence of the ſeditious, (and eſpecially of thoſe who, the year before, were, by the decree of the Judges, delegated from Paris, proſcribed, who hoped that, by this courſe, they ſhould both revenge the injury offered them, and alſo obliterate the memory of the Decree), many were thrown into priſon, and afterwards 15 Kal. of VIII br. being called out one by one by the voice of the Cryer, were cruelly ſlain by thoſe Emiſſaries, <note place="margin">Septemb. 17.</note>

This the Senate was in ſhew offended at, and began to proceed againſt the Authors of this fact: but through connivance it came to nothing, the murderers and cut-throats for a time ſlipping out of the City.</p>

Among thoſe Commentaries which he did every day diligently write, which were afterwards deſtroyed by the Queens command, there was a paſſage in which he adviſed the King that he ſhould be ſparing in aſſigning the hereditary portion, which they call Appennage, to his Brethren, and in giving them authority, which having read, and acquainting Alanſon with it, whom ſhe had perceived to favour Coligny; This is your beloved cordial friend, ſaith the Queen, who thus adviſed the King.

                  <p>Again, there was among his papers found a breviate, wherein, among other reaſons that he gave for the neceſſity of a War with the Spaniards in the Low-Countreys, this was added, as being omitted in the Speech which he made to the King, leſt it ſhould be divulged, and therefore was to be ſecretly communicated to the King, that if the King did not accept of the condition that the Low-Countreys offered, he ſhould<note n="†" place="margin">V.

Which being likewiſe imparted to Walſingham, Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeths Ambaſſador, and the Queen telling him, that by that he might judge how well Coligny was affected towards the Queen his Miſtreſs, who ſo much loved him. He made her almoſt the ſame anſwer, and ſaid, <q>He did not know how he was affected towards the Queen his Miſtreſs; but this he knew, that that counſel did ſavour of one that was faithful to the King, and moſt ſtudious of the honour of France, and in whoſe death both the King and all France had a great loſs.</q> So both of them, by almoſt the ſame anſwer, fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her womaniſh policy, not without ſhame unto her ſelf.</p>
                  <p>About the end of the month wherein Coligny was ſlain, <hi>the King</hi> fearing leſt the Proteſtants ſhould grow deſperate in other Provinces, <hi>writes to the Governors with</hi> moſt ample com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,<note place="margin">Carnii Comes.</note> and principally to <hi>Feliomrus Chabolius</hi> Preſident of Burgundy, in which he commanded that he ſhould go through the Cities and Towns that were under his juriſdiction, and friendly convene the Proteſtants, and acquaint them with the tumult at Paris, and the true cauſes thereof. <q>That nothing was done in that affair through hatred of their Religion, or in prejudice to the favour that was granted them by the laſt Edict: but that he might prevent the conſpiracy made by Coligny and his confederates againſt the King, the Queen, the King's Brethren, the King of Navar, and other Princes and Nobles. That it was the King's pleaſure that his Edicts might be obſerved, and that the Proteſtants every where taking forth Letters of ſecurity from the Preſidents, ſhould live quietly and ſafely under the King's protection, upon pain of death to any that ſhould injure or moleſt them in any thing. On the other hand, he ſhould admoniſh the Proteſtants that they ſhould keep themſelves quiet at home; and becauſe in their Meetings and publick Aſſemblies there uſed to be ſuch Counſels among the Proteſtants as were ſuſpitious to

But if they ſhould fooliſhly neglect this advice, command and promiſe of the King, and ſhould preſume to meet publickly, ſtir up troubles, and take up Arms under colour of their own defence, he would then proceed againſt them as againſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels.</q> To the ſame effect were Letters ſent to <hi>Melchior Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſatus,</hi> Preſident of Poictou, <hi>Pria</hi> Preſident of Toures, and the Preſidents of other Provinces. <hi>Chabolius</hi> managed his office with great prudence and moderation, having learnt that the Proteſtants, who had hitherto been exaſperated by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and cruelty of puniſhments, might be better reduced to their duty by clemency and mildneſs. And matters were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered without almoſt any bloud-ſhed in <hi>Burgundy;</hi> many returning either through fear, or of their own accord, to the Religion of their Anceſtors, renouncing the Proteſtant Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.

So foul a tempeſt in France being in ſome ſort allayed, and the liberty of killing and plundering repreſſed, when the more prudent, that yet no way favoured the Proteſtant party, did, upon the ſad thought of the preſent ſtate of things, by little and little, come to themſelves, and abhorring the fact, did curiouſly enquire into the cauſes of it, and how it might be excuſed, they thus judged, <q>That <hi>no example of like cruelty</hi> could be found <hi>in all Antiquity,</hi> though we turned over the Annals of all Nations. Theſe kinds of outrages had been confined to certain men, or to one place, and might have been excuſed by the ſenſe of injury newly offered, or their rage did only exerciſe it ſelf upon thoſe whom it was their intereſt to remove out of the way. For ſo by the command of <hi>Mithridates</hi> King of Pontus upon one meſſage, and the
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:31919:37"/> ſignification of one Letter 40000 Romans were ſlain in one day throughout all Aſia.<note place="margin">The Sicilian Veſpers.</note> So <hi>Peter King of Arragon</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded 8000 French-men to be ſlain in Sicily, who had ſeized upon it in his abſence: But their caſe was far different from this: For thoſe Kings exerciſed their rage upon ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and foreigners, but this (King) upon his own ſubjects, who were not more committed to his power than to his faith and truſt. <hi>They</hi> were obliged no otherwiſe by their faith given than to the ſtrangers themſelves, but <hi>he</hi> was bound in a late league with his neighbouring Kings and Princes, to keep that Peace which he had ſworn to. <hi>They</hi> uſed no arts unworthy of royal dignity to deceive them, <hi>he</hi> for a ſnare abuſed his new engaged friendſhip, and the ſacred Nuptials of his own Siſter, whoſe wedding garment was even ſtained with bloud. Theſe are the vertues that uſe to be commended in Kings, Juſtice, Gentleneſs and Clemency; but ſavageneſs and cruelty, as in all others, ſo eſpecially in Princes uſe to be condemned. Famous through all ages was Publius Scipip, who was wont to ſay he had rather ſave one Citizen, than ſlay a thouſand enemies; and Antonius, who was called the Pious, did often uſe that ſaying. Kings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have power of life and death over the Subjects of their Realm, but with this limitation, that they ſhould not proceed againſt them till their cauſe was heard upon a fair tryal. This rage and blindneſs of mind was ſent by God upon the French, as a judgment for the daily execrations and reproaches of the Deity, from which the King himſelf, ill educated by his Mother, and by thoſe Tutors that ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, did not at all abſtain; the example whereof proceeding from the Court to the Cities, and from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to the Country Towns and Villages, they now at every third word, ſwore by the head, death, bloud, heart of God. Moreover, the patience of God was even wearied with their Whoredoms, Adulteries, and ſuch luſts as are not fit to be ſpoken. Laſtly, nature it ſelf doth now expoſtulate as it were with God for his ſo long patience and forbearance, nor could the Country of France any longer bear ſuch prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous wickedneſs. For as for <hi>the cauſes</hi> which are <hi>pretended
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:31919:37"/> againſt Coligny,</hi> they are feigned with ſuch improbability, that they can hardly perſwade children, much leſs can they be proved. For how is it probable that Coligny ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into ſuch a conſpiracy within the walls of Paris, who though he were guilty before the Pacification, (to ſuppoſe that), yet certainly after the Edict, if indeed the publick Faith and the King's promiſes ought to be obſerved, he came to the King guiltleſs, altogether abhorring a Civil War, and ſolicitous only about the Belgick War? But whereas they ſay he conſpired-after he had received his wounds, this hath leſs colour of truth. For how could Coligny that was indiſpoſed by two ſuch wounds, now grown old, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in both his arms, one of which the Phyſitians talked of cutting off, riſe with three hundred young men that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended him, againſt an Army of ſixty thouſand men, that bare him deadly hatred, and that were well appointed with Arms? How could he in ſo little time conſult concerning ſo great and vaſt a deſign? for he lived hardly forty hours af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had received his wound, in which all conference was forbidden him by his Phyſitians. Then, had he been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of any crime, was he not committed to Coſſenius and his guards, and the paſſages being every where ſecured, was he not in the King's power, that he might in a moment, if it had ſo pleaſed the King, been thruſt into priſon? and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes being prepared, after the manner of judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, might he not have been proceeded againſt in form of Law? Moreover, if Coligni with his Dependents and Clients had conſpired againſt the King, why muſt needs the reſt that were innocent, ſo many Noble Matrons and Virgins who came thither upon the account of the Marriage, ſo many great-bellied women, ſo many ancient perſons, ſo many bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridden perſons of both Sexes and all profeſſions, that were ignorant of theſe laſt counſels of Coligni, be comprehended in the ſame guilt? To whom doth it not ſeem abſurd and moſt ridiculous that Coligni ſhould at ſo unſeaſonable a time conſpire againſt Navar that profeſſed the ſame Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with him, and whom he had in his power for four
<pb n="019" facs="tcp:31919:38"/> years together? Thus many did diſcourſe, and ſo they judged, that upon the account of this fact the French Name would for a long time labour under an odium and infamy, and that poſterity would never forget an act of ſo great unworthineſs.</q>

                     <hi>deteſted</hi> Conſpiracy entred into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt the King of <hi>Great Britain;</hi> which being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered about the end of this year [1605] was in the next year ſuppreſſed by the Death of the Conſpirators.</p>
                  <p>To the Petition for Liberty of Conſcience made by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the former Seſſion of Parliament, and rejected by the King, there was a rumour there would be another preferred at the next Seſſions, (which had been now often deferred) which ſhould be in no danger of being denyed as the former, but ſhould carry with it a neceſſity of being granted by the King whither he would or not. Therefore thoſe that mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Affairs of the Kingdom under a generous and no wayes ſuſpicious King, fearing nothing worſe, did make it their buſineſs to avoid ſuch Petitions, and that neceſſity that did attend them. But among the Conſpirators it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:31919:40"/> not, how they might obtain the Kings favour, which they now deſpaired of; but how they might revenge that repulſe, though with the ruine of the Kingdom, which the other never thought of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The beginning of theſe Counſels</hi> are to be derived from the latter end of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> For then, as appeared afterwards by proofs and confeſſions, <hi>Robert Winter</hi> (to whom <hi>Oſwald Teſmond</hi> alias <hi>Greenwell,</hi> of the Society of the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> joyned himſelf as his Companion) was by the advice of <hi>Hen. Garnet,</hi> Provincial or Superiour of the ſaid Society in <hi>England (Robert Cateſby</hi> and <hi>Francis Treſham</hi> of the Gentry, inſtigating) pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately <hi>ſent into</hi> Spain, in the name of the Catholicks, with Letters Commendatory to <hi>Arthur Creſwell</hi> of the ſame Society living in <hi>Spain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dec. <hi>1601.</hi> Mandatis.</note> and with Commands to the King; of which this was the ſumme.</p>
                  <p>That he ſhould forthwith ſend an Army into <hi>England,</hi> for which the Catholicks would be ready in Arms as ſoon as it came over. In the mean while that he ſhould aſſign yearly Penſions to ſome Catholick Gentlemen. Furthermore, that he ſhould inſinuate it to the King, that there were ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and Military perſons that were aggrieved at the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things, whom he might eaſily draw to his Part, by relieving their neceſſities. And whereas the greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, after the Landing ſuch an Army, would be for ſupply of Horſes; they in <hi>England</hi> would take care to have Two thouſand Horſes ready provided upon all occaſions.</p>
                  <p>This thing was ſecretly tranſacted by the Mediation of <hi>Creſwell</hi> with <hi>Petrus Franceſa</hi> Secretary to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Franciſcus Sandovallius</hi> Duke of <hi>Lerma,</hi> and he affirmed that the thing would be very acceptable to King <hi>Philip,</hi> and that he had offered his utmoſt aſſiſtance: that it was alſo agreed among them of the Place of Landing. For if the forces were great, then <hi>Kent</hi> and <hi>Eſſex</hi> would be moſt commodious for their Landing; if leſs, <hi>Milford</hi> in <hi>Wales;</hi> and that King <hi>Philip</hi> had promiſed by Count <hi>Miranda</hi> toward that Expedition Ten hundred thouſand Crowns.<note place="margin">Decies centena aureorum <hi>M.</hi>
                     </note> Stored with theſe promiſes, <hi>Winter</hi> returns into <hi>England,</hi> and acquaints <hi>Garnet, Catesby,</hi> and <hi>Treſham</hi> what he had done.</p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:31919:40"/>
                  <p>Theſe things were tranſacted under Q <hi>Elizabeth:</hi> who dying about this time, <hi>Chriſtopher Wright</hi> who was privy to theſe Matters, is ſpeedily <hi>ſent into Spain,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mar.</hi> 1603.</note> who bringing the News of the Queens Death,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sir</hi> Will. Stanly.</note> preſſeth the buſineſs of the Penſions and the Expedition. With him was ſent from <hi>Bruxells</hi> by <hi>William Stanly, Hugh Owen,</hi> and <hi>Balduinus,</hi> (one of the Society of the <hi>Jeſuits) Guido Fawkes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">22 <hi>Jun.</hi> 1603.</note> with Letters to <hi>Creſwell</hi> that he ſhould ſpeed the buſineſs. To him was given in Command, that he ſhould ſignifie to the King that the Condition of the Catholicks, would be more hard under the new King, then it had been under <hi>Q. Elizabeth;</hi> and therefore that he ſhould by no means deſiſt from ſo laudable an Enterprize. That <hi>Milford</hi> lay open for an eaſie Landing to <hi>Spinola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the ſtate of things was changed by the death of the Queen, and King <hi>Philip</hi> returned an Anſwer worthy of a King, that he could no longer attend to their Petitions, for that he had ſent Ambaſſadors into <hi>England,</hi> to treat of Peace with the new King.</p>
                  <p>Therefore deſpairing of their deſign as to King <hi>Philip,</hi> the Conſpirators fly to their laſt and deſperate Counſels, and in the firſt place they make it <hi>their buſineſs to ſatisfie their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences,</hi> and that being done, they confirm their reſolutions to attempt ſome great Enterprize. And <hi>thus their Divines diſcourſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To depoſe Kings, to grant their Kingdoms to others, is in the power of the Supream Judge of the Church; But all Hereticks being <hi>ipſo jure</hi> ſeparated from communion of the Faithful, are every year on Holy <hi>Thurſday,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Caena Domini.</note> excommunicated by the Pope. And this holdeth not only in Profeſſed Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but in thoſe that are covertly ſuch, becauſe being repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>ipſo Jure</hi> Excommunicate they do incur the (ſame) Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, which are <hi>ipſo facto</hi> deſerved by profeſſed Hereticks. From thence it follows, that Kings and other Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces if they fall into Hereſie may be depoſed, and their Subjects diſcharged of their Allegiance. Nor can they recover their Right again, no, not though they ſhould be reconciled to the Church. When it is ſaid that the Church, the Common Mother of all, doth ſhut her boſome againſt none that
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:31919:41"/> return to her, this is to be underſtood with a diſtinction, <hi>viz.</hi> provided it be not to the damage or danger of the Church. For this is true as to the Soul, but not as to the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Nor ought this puniſhment to be extended only to Princes that are thus infected, but alſo to their Sons, who for their Fathers Sin are excluded from Succeſſion in the Kingdom. For Hereſie is a Leproſie, and an Hereditary Diſeaſe: and to ſpeak more plainly, he loſeth his Kingdom that deſerteth the <hi>Roman</hi> Religion: he is to be accurſed, abdicated, proſcribed; neither is he, nor any of his Poſterity to be reſtored to the Kingdom: as to his Soul, he may be abſolved by the Pope only.</p>
                  <p>Thinking themſelves abundantly ſecured <hi>within</hi> by theſe reaſonings, they begin to ſeek <hi>outward</hi> ſtrengthenings to their Conſpiracy: and chiefly <hi>Secreſie,</hi> which they ſealed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and the receiving of the Sacrament. To this end there was <hi>an Oath drawn up amongſt them,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>May,</hi> 1604.</note> in which they did engage their Faith by the H. Trinity and the Sacrament, which they were preſently to receive, that they would neither di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly nor indirectly by word or circumſtance diſcover the Plot now to be communicated to them, nor would they deſiſt from proſecuting it, unleſs allowed by their Aſſociates.</p>
                  <p>Thus being encouraged by the Authority of their Divines, they be take themſelves to the adventure (as) not only lawful &amp; laudable, but meritorious. This was done before <hi>John Gerard</hi> of that Society.</p>
                  <p>Unto this, after Confeſſion, by the Sacrament of the Holy Altar, were drawn in, the next <hi>May,</hi> at firſt five of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, <hi>Robert Catesby, Tho. Winter, Tho. Percy,</hi> Kinſman to the E. of <hi>Northumberland, John Wright,</hi> and the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned <hi>Fawkes</hi> called out of <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Catesby, the Author of this Tragedy,</hi> thought it not enough that this, or that, or any ſingle perſon ſhould be aimed at, but that all, together, and at the ſame time, ſhould be comprehended in this Conſpiracy.</p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:31919:41"/>
                  <p>For ſo he reaſoned with himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The King himſelf might many wayes be taken away, but this would be nothing as long as the Prince and the Duke of <hi>York</hi> were alive: again, if they were removed, yet this would advantage nothing ſo long as there remained a Parliament, ſo vigilant, ſo circumſpect to whatever might happen: or if the Parliament could or the chief Members of it, could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, there would remain ſtill the Peers of the Realm; ſo many Prudent Perſons, ſo many powerful Earls, addicted to that Party, whom they could hardly reſiſt, and who by their Authority, Wealth and Dependants, would be able, if occaſion ſhould be, to reſtore things to their former ſtate. Therefore not by delayes, but at one blow all were to be ſwallowed up, and ſo laudable an Atchievement was to be brought to effect altogether, and at once.</p>
                  <p>At <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> there is an old Palace of very great Honor and Veneration for its Antiquity, in which the great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of the Kingdom are uſed to be celebrated; which by a word borrowed from us, they call a Parliament. In this, the King with His Male iſſue, the Biſhops of His Privy Councel, the Peers, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility, the Chief Magiſtrates, and thoſe that are delegated from particular Counties, Cities, Towns, and Burroughs; in ſhort, the Men of greateſt Wiſdom and Counſel do meet together.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Catesby</hi> thought a convenient place to execute his ſo long ſtudied and digeſted Plot: and having made a Vault, and ſtoring it with a great quantity of Gun-Powder, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve all thoſe together, who could not ſeverally be taken, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the King and His Family in the Rubbiſh of the ſame Ruines.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when he had dealt with <hi>Piercy,</hi> and he after many bitter complaints of the King, through impatience, broke forth into theſe words, <q>That there was only one way left to be delivered from ſo many Evils, and that was to take the King out of the way, and to that end, as he was ready for any attempt, did freely offer his own Service.</q> 
                     <hi>Catesby,</hi> who was more cautious and cunning, moderated the Gentlemans heat, and, <q>God forbid, ſaid he, that this Head of thine ſo
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31919:42"/> dear to all good men ſhould be ſo fruitleſly expoſed to ſuch danger. The buſineſs may be undertaken and accompliſhed, yet ſo as that you and ſuch as you are may ſtill be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for further conſulting for Religion and the Publick weal.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then he opens his deſign in very plauſible words, and with like Artifice ſhews him the manner how it was to be effected. <hi>Piercy</hi> agrees, and preſently hires an Houſe nigh to the place, and very opportune to work his Vault.</p>
                  <p>The Parliament that was called the year before, was deferred till <hi>February</hi> following.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nov.</hi> 1604.</note> Mean while, <hi>Tho. Bates, Catesby</hi>'s Servant, a dextrous Fellow, and one in whom his Maſter did much confide, being, leaſt he ſhould ſuſpect any thing, taken into the privity of the Fact, when at firſt be ſeemed to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the horridneſs of the thing, he is ſent to <hi>Teſmund</hi> alias <hi>Greenwell,</hi> (for thoſe men, that they might the better be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcovered, went under two Names, ſometimes under three) by whom he was perſwaded, and ſtrangely confirmed to the Execution of the deſign, being made ſenſible of the Merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of the work. Afterwards <hi>Roben Keyes,</hi> and after him <hi>Ambroſe Rockwood,</hi> and <hi>John Grant,</hi> were taken into the Plot. III Eid. Xbr. <hi>the Vault</hi> was <hi>begun,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dec.</hi> 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſtopher Winhie,</hi> and a little after <hi>Robert Winter</hi> being alſo taken into the Society.</p>
                  <p>The work being often intermitted and often repeated, at length the Vault was brought to the Wall of the Court, where a new difficulty ariſeth from the hardneſs of the Wall, and the thickneſs of three Ells; ſo that under a long time the work could not be finiſhed, and there were now but a few dayes to the ſitting of the Parliament.</p>
                  <p>And now the pertinacious induſtry of the Workmen had almoſt beat its way through the middle of the Wall, and they ſeemed not ſo much to want good minds (to the work) as time, when as <hi>the Parliament</hi> was <hi>put off till</hi> the Month of <hi>October.</hi> Then <hi>was Deſpair</hi> turned into Joy, with certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence that they ſhould effect their deſign: and it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that whiles they brithly beat upon the Wall, there was a noiſe heard upon the other ſide of the Wall. Thither <hi>Fawks</hi> is ſent to enquire out the cauſe. He brings word back that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:31919:42"/> there was <hi>a Cellar under Ground,</hi> from whence they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving Cole, he beinſt lately Dead who had hired that Cellar for his own uſe. Therefore the Conſpirators thinking that Cellar more commodious, by the help of <hi>Piercy,</hi> let out their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Houſes, and bring all their <hi>Materials</hi> &amp; hopes into this. Such was the opportuneneſs of the place (for it was almoſt directly under the Royal Throne) that ſo ſeaſonable an accident did make them perſwade themſelves, that God did by a ſecret Conduct favour their Attempt. Theſe things happened about the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter.</hi> The Gun-powder is at their leiſure carried into the Cellar from <hi>Catesby</hi>'s Houſe over againſt the Palace, where it had been with great care and diligence brought together; Firſt, Twenty Barrels are layed in and covered with Billets and Faggots.</p>
                  <p>Then the Conſpirators being ſure of the good event, began to <hi>conſult what was to be done after they had effected their Plot:</hi> Firſt, they conſider'd of taking the Prince, who about that time, they came to underſtand, would not come to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with his Father, contrary to what they concluded in the beginning, and againſt him they plotted deſtruction, as one that was no Friend of theirs, and they had found out a way for it.</p>
                  <p>The next care was for <hi>Supplies of Money,</hi> concerning which they thought they had ſufficiently provided. They had alſo provided that the <hi>Peers and Gentry addicted to Popery,</hi> ſhould, as much as might be, be <hi>exempt</hi> from danger. Laſtly, they debated concerning <hi>calling in Forreign Princes</hi> to their aſſiſtance; but being doubtful of their faith and ſecreſie, they thought fit not to ſend to them till they had accompliſhed their deſign; for commonly ſuch Actions are not commended but by their Event.</p>
                  <p>They paſſed their Judgments upon them ſeverally, <hi>the Spaniards</hi> ſeemed to be more opportune for them, but too remote, and too ſlow in raiſing Forces. <hi>The French</hi> was near, but fearful and ſuſpected for the cloſe league he held with the <hi>Dutch.</hi> The moſt preſent help was from <hi>Flanders,</hi> from whence they might moſt commodiouſly expect Supplies; for which <hi>Stanly</hi> was deſigned the Captain or Commander.</p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="tcp:31919:43"/>
                  <p>Moreover, that they might the more eaſily deceive the world, and leaſt by their paſſing to and fro to thoſe places they ſhould give ſome cauſe of Suſpition, <hi>they go their ſeveral wayes;</hi> ſome into the Countrey, ſome a great way out of the Iſland, waiting for the time appointed for the Execution. <hi>Fawks</hi> went into <hi>Flanders</hi> that he might acquaint <hi>Stanly</hi> and <hi>Owen</hi> with the whole Matter, nor did he return into <hi>England</hi> till the latter end of <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Catesby,</hi> that he might not be idle in the mean time, gets <hi>Francis Treſham</hi> and <hi>Everard Digby</hi> to his Party, agreeing with them for <hi>Supply of Money,</hi> and the former promiſd Two thouſand pounds of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, the other Fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. <hi>Piercy,</hi> that was prodigal at another mans charge, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed whatſoever he could ſcrape together of the Revenues of the E. of <hi>Northumberland.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time, <hi>Ten more Barrels of Gun-powder</hi> are added to the former, and four more greater than the reſt, upon ſuſpition, leaſt by the moiſtneſs of the place, the former ſhould have been ſpoiled; and again, they are all covered over with a great heap of ſtones and wood</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:31919:43"/> to their Parts and Obedience; and the <hi>odiouſneſs</hi> of their fact ſo by degrees diſcovering it ſelf would in time, and together with their good ſucceſs grow off.</p>
                  <p>Nor came it in ſo long time into the minds of any of them how many Innocents all about them, how many Infants, how many that agreed with them in Religion, how many who perhaps had deſerved well of them that vaſt ruine would over-whelm.</p>
                  <p>Now all things are ready, and the laſt Scene was going to be Acted, when as by the unſearchable Judgment of God, one who deſired to ſave another, brought deſtruction both to himſelf and his Aſſociates.</p>
                  <p>There were ten dayes to the Parliament, when upon <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday</hi> in the Evening a Letter was brought as from a Friend to the Lord <hi>Monteagle,</hi> but by whom written, is uncertain, and by whom brought unknown. By it he was warned to forbear meeting at the Parliament for the two firſt dayes of the Seſſion; foraſmuch as ſome great, and ſudden, and unſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted miſchief did threaten that Meeting.</p>
                  <p>The hand of him that wrote it was unknown, and the writing it ſelf purpoſely ſo ordered, that it could hardly be read. No date to the Letter, no ſubſcription, no inſcription put to it, and the whole compoſure of words ambiguous.</p>
                  <p>The Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> was doubtful what he ſhould do; therefore late in the night he goeth to <hi>Robert Cecil</hi> Earl of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisbury,</hi> and chief Secretary to the King, and giving him the Letter, freely declared to him how he came by it, and how little he valued it. <hi>Cecil</hi> did not make much more account of it, and yet thought it was not altogether to be neglected; and Therefore ſhewed it to the chief Councellors, <hi>Charles Howard,</hi> Chief Admiral of the Seas, the Earl of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to the Earls of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> and <hi>Northampton.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The thing being conſidered of amongſt them, although at firſt ſight the Letter ſeemed of no great moment; yet they thought that not the ſlighteſt diſcovery ought to be deſpiſed, eſpecially where the ſafety of the King was endangered, nor ſuch great care to be blamed in them, to whom the preſervation of His Majeſty did both by Office and Duty belong.</p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:31919:44"/>
                  <p>The King was then gone to <hi>Royſton,</hi> to Hunt. It ſeemed good to them to determine nothing before they had conſulted the King. For they ſaid that they had oftentimes experienced the quick apprehenſion, and <hi>happy conjecture</hi> of the King in <hi>unriddleing things that were liable to greateſt doubtfulneſs.</hi>

                     </note>Upon the Calends of <hi>November, the King returned</hi> to the City, and forth with <hi>Cecil</hi> taking him aſide, unfolds the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſhews him <hi>the Letter,</hi> which it ſeems worth while to inſert here for the perpetual remembrance of it; foraſmuch as not without cauſe it afforded ſuch matter of diſpute between him and his Councellors.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The love which I bear to ſome of your Friends makes me careful for your ſafety. Wherefore I adviſe you, as you love your life, that you would invent ſome excuſe for your abſence from the Parliament. For God and Men, as it were by agreement do haſten to puniſh the wickedneſs of this Age. Do not make light of this warning, but depart as ſoon as you can into your own Countrey, where you may ſecurely expect the event. For although no ſigns of troubles do appear, yet I admoniſh you, that that meeting ſhall receive a terrible blow, and ſhall not ſee who ſmiteth them. Do not deſpiſe this diſcovery, it may be profitable to you, it cannot hurt you. For the danger is over as ſoon as you have burnt this Letter. I hope by the grace of God you will make good uſe of this Counſell, to whoſe protection I commend you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King having read the Letter (though through the generouſneſs of his mind, he was no way prone to ſuſpicion) did conjecture that ſome ſtrange thing did lye hid under it, and that the notice given, was by no means to be neglected.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, <hi>Cecil</hi> ſaid, it was certainly written by ſome Mad man: For no man well in his wits would ſpeak at this rate of a danger which he doth admoniſh ſo much to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of. <hi>The danger is over as ſoon as you ſhall burn the Letter.</hi> How ſmall a danger could that be which ſhould vaniſh in ſo ſhort a moment.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide the King, in whoſe breaſt the firſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had a now taken deep root, urged the foregoing words, <hi>That aſſembly ſhall receive a terrible blow, and ſhall not ſee who
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:31919:44"/> ſmiteth them.</hi> And whiles walking in the Gallery he deeply thought of theſe things from one particular to another, it came into his mind that a ſudden blow by Gun-powder was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by thoſe words: For what more ſudden then a blow by Gun-powder?</p>
                  <p>Thus the King and <hi>Salisbury</hi> ſo broke off their diſcourſe, that the King did ſtrongly perſevere in his conjecture. <hi>Salisbury</hi> to free the Kings mind from fears and cares ſeemed in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence to make light of this notice given; but in the mean time admiring within himſelf the Kings uncouth and unuſual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, and ſo preſently ſuſpecting it, did conclude, that it was not lightly to be regarded.</p>
                  <p>The next day the thing being again conſidered of by the King, and His Counſellors, it ſeemed good that the <hi>Palace</hi> with the places near adjoyning, ſhould be diligently ſearched, and that buſineſs was aſſigned to the Lord <hi>Chamberlain,</hi> who upon the <hi>Monday</hi> which preceded the Parliament, about the Evening, that he might give no occaſion of Rumours, goes with the Lord <hi>Monteagle</hi> to thoſe places: entring into the houſe that <hi>Percy</hi> had hired, they found a great heap of Billets and Fagots and Coal in a Vault under ground; and <hi>Wineard</hi> the Keeper of the Kings <hi>houſes</hi> being there preſent,<note place="margin">Wardrobe.</note> he was asked for what uſe they were brought in thither? they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood that the houſe was hired by <hi>Percy,</hi> and that heap was brought in by him.</p>
                  <p>Moreover the Chamberlain ſpying <hi>Fawks</hi> ſtanding in a corner of the Cellar, asked who he was, and what buſineſs he had there? Who anſwered, that he was the Domeſtick Servant of <hi>Percy,</hi> and the Keeper of that houſe in <hi>Percy</hi>'s abſence.</p>
                  <p>Having thus done, they return to the Court, reporting What they had ſeen, and conjecturing worſe things then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly they had done. For it came into <hi>Monteagles</hi> mind upon the mention of <hi>Percy,</hi> that he was highly addicted to the Popiſh Religion, that they had formerly been acquainted, and lived as Friends, and it might be that he was the Author of that Letter which gave ground to all this ſuſpition.</p>
                  <p>The Lord Chamberlain among other ſuſpicious matters, did revolve in his mind, that that ſtore of wood in the houſe of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31919:45"/> 
                     <hi>Percy,</hi> where he ſeldom reſided, was not brought in thither to no purpoſe, and that that Servant of <hi>Percy</hi> whom he ſaw in the Cellar, looked like a deſperate, wicked Knave.</p>
                  <p>All which things did increaſe the Kings ſuſpition, who would have that Vault further ſearched again; but leaſt if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing were found, the Counſellors ſhould make themſelves ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to the People, as if they were afraid of every light report; and moreover, fearing, leaſt whiles they appeared to ſuſpect <hi>Percy,</hi> who was allied in Blood to the chiefeſt Peers of the Realm, they ſhould ſeem to ſuſpect the Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> himſelf: yet when the ſafety of the King did prevail upon them, they ſo ordered the matter, that ſearch ſhould be made without noiſe or injury to any.</p>
                  <p>It was given in command to Sir <hi>Thomas Knevet,</hi> Juſtice of Peace for <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that in the dead of the Night he ſhould go with a convenient company to that houſe, and ſhould take <hi>Wineard</hi> a long with him, under pretence that he had loſt ſome Hangings and Tapeſtry.</p>
                  <p>Thither Sir <hi>Tho. Knevet</hi> going, finds <hi>Fawks, Percy</hi>'s Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Servant, who under a feigned name called himſelf <hi>John Johnſon,</hi> before the Houſe booted and habited for a Journey; and he gives command preſently to lay hold on him. From thence going into the Cellar, he ſpeedily removes the Wood and Coal, which being removed, the Treaſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, one little Barrel of Gun-powder being firſt diſcovered by it ſelf, and afterward the heap being removed 36 Barrels of different magnitude were found there.</p>
                  <p>Then turning to the Priſoner, and examining his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they found in them tinder, and three Match cords.</p>
                  <p>But he being taken in the Fact, and not able to deny, the caſe being now deſperate, he of his own accord confeſſed the Crime, and with an unappalled countenance (as he was a man of a reſolute mind to undertake any deſperate attempt) he added, that it was well for them that they found him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the houſe, now lately come out of the Cellar, in which all things were ready: for if they had found him within, he would not have ſtood to have buried himſelf and them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by putting fire to the Train.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:31919:45"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Knevet</hi> having diſcovered the matter, returns forthwith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing to the Palace, about Four a Clock in the Morning, and acquaints <hi>Salisbury</hi> and the Lord Chamberlain; who preſently with a noiſe ruſh into the Kings Bed Chamber, and tell him the Treaſon was detected, and they had the Author of it in Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody and Bonds.</p>
                  <p>The fame of this being ſpread abroad, for in ſo great a matter of Joy it could not be concealed, <hi>the Conſpirators fly</hi> ſome this way, ſome that way, and <hi>meet together at</hi> Holbech at the houſe of <hi>Stephen Littleton,</hi> in the borders of <hi>Stafford-ſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thither came thoſe that were privy to the Conſpiracy out of <hi>Warwick ſhire</hi> and <hi>Worceſter-ſhire;</hi> although they were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the diſcovery of the Plot, having taken away by force from Gentlemens houſes their Warr-horſes; thereby giving a manifeſt token what they would have done when they had got the power in their hands, when as they ravaged with ſuch boldneſs, while the event was yet doubtful.</p>
                  <p>The Leaders of the Faction truſted that great numbers of Men, and a conſiderable Army would flock into them, as ſoon as they ſhould appear in Arms. But the Lieutenants and Sheriffs being before, while the Treaſon was only ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, Commanded by the King to ride about their Counties, their attempts were all made void, and ſcarcely an Hundred of all that number appeared in Arms. And they were encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by <hi>Richard Walſh,</hi> High Sheriff of the County of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> who came upon them unexpectedly with a ſtrong power of Men, ſo that they could not eſcape.</p>
                  <p>When deſpairing of Pardon, and their troubled Conſciences putting them upon deſperate exploits, the <hi>Gun-powder</hi> that was drying by the Fire, took fire by a ſparkle that fell into it, and ſo ſuddenly burnt the Faces, Sides, Arms, Hands of the Beſieged, that they were rendered unable to handle their Arms, and ſo loſt their ſtrength and courage together.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Percy,</hi> that were moſt active, together with <hi>Tho.

                  <p>Being <hi>Examined</hi> without the rack, (for only <hi>Fawks</hi> was put under this way of Examination, and that but moderately) they ſeverally diſcovered the whole ſeries of the matter as we have before recounted, and taxed none in Holy Orders, which many looked upon as purpoſely avoided, becauſe they were bound by Oath not to do it. When as <hi>Francis Treſham</hi> had before he dyed in Priſon of his own accord nominated <hi>Henry Garnet,</hi> being admoniſhed thereof by his Wife he wrote a Letter to the Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and excuſing his too raſh confeſſion, he ſo <hi>diſcharged</hi> Garnet <hi>as much as in him lay</hi> by a ſolemn adjuration interpoſed, that he did entangle him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a notorious lye, affirming<note n="†" place="margin">He took it upon his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in <hi>articulo mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> (a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thing) for within three hours after he dyed. <hi>Proceedings againſt the late Traitors.

                  </p>
                  <p>This likewiſe was worthy the Wiſdom of a moſt juſt Prince, that he did Judge that no <hi>Forreign Prince</hi> nor Common-wealth, nor none that did manage affairs for them had any hand in this Conſpiracy, as who did judg of them according to his own mind and temper, and would think of others what he would that they ſhould think of him.</p>
                  <p>Therefore he did will and require, that when any mention ſhould be made of this Conſpiracy in Parliament, every one ſhould ſpeak and think honourably of them. Which thing was done for the reſpect that he bore to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with whom deſiring to keep that peace which he of late made with them, he would not leave any the leaſt appearance of an alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated affection or a ſuſpicious mind.</p>
                  <p>He added this moſt generouſly, That, <hi>he would that all men ſhould underſtand, that reſting in Gods protection, the tranquility and quiet of his mind was not at all diſturbed by this accident, and that he did wiſh that his breaſt were tranſparent to all,

Garnet</hi> and —<hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Garnets Servant</hi> were <hi>taken</hi> in the houſe of <hi>Abington</hi> a Papiſt, and ſent to <hi>London,</hi> and caſt into the <hi>Tower.</hi> The wretched Servant for fear leaſt he ſhould be forced by torments to accuſe his Maſter, or deſpairing upon ſome other account, did lay violent hands upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the Priſon, and with a blunt knife (for he was not permitted to have a keen one by him) he <hi>cut up his own Belly,</hi> and drew out his Bowels: and although his wound was bound up yet before he could be Examined, he dyed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Garnet</hi> was <hi>very gently uſed</hi> in his Impriſonment, as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterward confeſſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>At firſt he denyed all things;</hi> and when it did appear that nothing could be drawn from him voluntarily, and the King that he might avoid calumny was unwilling to uſe <hi>torments</hi> upon him, reſolves by craft to illude his <hi>cautious</hi> pertinacy, and to bring him to larger Confeſſions (who would anſwer little or nothing) <hi>whether he would or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſecretly imploys a man, who by deep groans, and frequent complaints againſt the King, and his Counſellors,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:31919:48"/> and the deplorable condition of the Catholicks in <hi>England,</hi> did in the end perſwade <hi>Garnet</hi> that he was Popiſhly enclined, and ſo crept into intimate familiarity with him. This man he ſends with <hi>a Letter to a Gentlewoman,</hi> that was Impriſoned for her Religion, who kept her family at <hi>Whitw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>b</hi> and other places, and received with great hoſpitality thoſe whom he commended to her. In which Letter he wrote plainly, and yet ſparingly: what things he had already confeſſed, what he was not yet examined upon, and by what means he would excuſe thoſe things (which he had confeſſed) and conceal theſe.</p>
                  <p>He wrote likewiſe to <hi>Rookwood</hi> the Prieſt, who was Priſoner in another Priſon, and wrote his <hi>Letter</hi> with Ink in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, about ſome familiar matters that any one might read, but left broad Margents on both ſides, which he filled with his Secrets, <hi>written with the juice of an Orange,</hi> denying all what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he had confeſſed before the Lords. As to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Expedition, he ſaid he had obtained the Kings Pardon. As to this laſt Conſpiracy he ſhould avoid Judgment, becauſe he knew they could make no ſufficient proofs againſt him. But however it went, he added, having too high an opinion of himſelf, that which was ſpoken of the only Redeemer of the world, It would be neceſſary that one man ſhould die for the People.</p>
                  <p>The Letter was by the Kings Councellors, who ſmelt out the cunning, held to the fire, and preſently the writing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, and the fraud was diſcovered.</p>
                  <p>He being every day more and more confident of his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Keeper, told him he did exceedingly deſire to have ſome conference with <hi>Hall,</hi> his Companion. He promiſed to bring it about, and brought both of them to a place where they might eaſily hear one another, and where he himſelf to avoid all ſuſpition might be ſeen by them both. In the mean time, <hi>he placed two men of known credit near the place</hi> who (they knowing no ſuch thing, and minding only the return of their Keeper who was gone abroad) might hear whatſoever paſſed between them. There each of them freely diſcover'd what they had confeſſed, what they had been Examined about, what excuſes and evaſions (for theſe were their words) they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31919:48"/> had prepared for every particular, and many other ſuch things, which being carefully taken, were delivered to the Counſel in writing. The next day (the Priſoners ſuſpecting no ſuch thing) Delegates from the King came to them, and Examine <hi>Garnet</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi> a part, and object to them that they had yeſterday held private conference with one another.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Garnet</hi> thinking they ſpoke this only upon conjecture<note n="†" place="margin">Upon his Soul, reiterating it with ſo many deteſtable exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations, as wounded the Lords hearts to hear him. <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, Y 3.</hi>
                     </note> ſtifly denyed it, and forſwore it upon the word of a Prieſt.</p>
                  <p>At laſt, <hi>Hall</hi> having confeſſed the Fact, and he finding that there was no avoiding it, begged Pardon for his contrary aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration which he ſought to elevate by a <hi>forced</hi> Interpretation or Equivocation. And profeſſing that he would ſpeak the truth ingenuouſly, He anſwered, that <hi>he had hitherto ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly denyed it, becauſe he knew that no man (living) but one, (he meant</hi> Greenwell, <hi>could accuſe him as guilty of the late Fact. But now that he ſaw himſelf encompaſſed with ſuch a cloud of witneſſes, he would no longer diſſemble, but did confeſs that above</hi> V <hi>moneths agone he was acquainted by</hi> Greenwell <hi>with the whole matter. That before that,</hi> Catesby <hi>had in general told him that the Catholicks in</hi> England <hi>were attempting ſome great thing as to Religion, and asked whether if good men ſhould be involved in the danger, this were to be made matter of Conſcience. But that he, who had a contrary command from the Pope, that he ſhould not engage in any Conſpiracy refuſed to hear any further of it. That he did pour out Prayers for the good ſucceſs of the great cauſe, and amongſt other things, uſed the Hymn that was commonly Sung in the Church, but intended nothing elſe when he did ſo, but only prayed God that in the next Parliament no grievous Lawes might be made againſt the Recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants:</hi> ſo they are called in <hi>England,</hi> who keeping within their own houſes, have their liberty and refuſe to Joyne in <hi>worſhip</hi> with the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Garnet</hi> being <hi>twenty times Examined,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">12 <hi>Feb.</hi> and 26 <hi>Mar.</hi>
                     </note> between <hi>the Eids of</hi> Febr. <hi>and the</hi> VII <hi>of the Calends of</hi> April, two dayes after he is arraigned at the Publick Tribunal in <hi>London:</hi>

                  <p>Here the Crimes are layed to the <hi>charge</hi> of the Priſoner, by Sir <hi>John Crook,</hi> which are afterwards enlarged on in a long Speech by Sir <hi>Edward Cook,</hi> the Kings Attorney General.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31919:49"/> Then after <hi>Garnet</hi> had ſaid ſomething for himſelf, and eſpecially ſomething concerning Equivocation, she was Examined by <hi>Cecil</hi> and others, that ſate as Judges in that caſe. And laſtly, <hi>the Earl of</hi> Northampton made a long and elaborate <hi>diſcourſe</hi> againſt him, in which he largely handled the Authority which the Popes arrogate to themſelves of depoſing Princes, and diſcuſſed that Chapter of <hi>Nos ſanctorum,</hi> the ground, as he ſaid, <hi>of this and ſuch like Conſpiracies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At length <hi>Sentence is paſſed</hi> by the <hi>Lord Chief Juſtice of the Kings Bench,</hi> that <hi>Garnet</hi> ſhould be Drawn, Hanged, and Quartered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>His Plea</hi> for himſelf was only this, that although he did a long time before know of the Conſpiracy, by common fame and Rumours, (for <hi>Greenwell</hi> only informed him of all the particulars; but under the Seal of Confeſſion, by the Laws of which he was forbidden to diſcover it to any man living): yet that he did admoniſh <hi>Greenwell</hi> to deſiſt from the Fact which he did very much diſapprove of, and to hinder others engaged in Conſcience or privity in it.</p>
                  <p>Here <hi>Cecill</hi> ſeverely <hi>reproved him,</hi> 
                     <q>For, ſaid he, if he did diſapprove of the Fact, why did he afford <hi>Greenwell</hi> the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Abſolution before he had by his penitence given teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that he did truly and from his heart deteſt the Fact? Furthermore when as he underſtood the matter from <hi>Catesby,</hi> where there was no Seal of Confeſſion, this was ſufficient to have made a diſcovery of the Plot if he had ſo highly abhorred it as he did pretend.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there were other things that lay heavy upon his charge, and theſe chiefly which were amongſt <hi>his Confeſſions,</hi> written with his own hand and ſent to the King, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                     <q>That <hi>Greenwell</hi> did acquaint him with this not as with a ſin (he had to confeſs) but as an Act which he well enough underſtood, and in which he required his advice and counſel.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>That <hi>Catesby</hi> and <hi>Greenwell</hi> came to him to require his advice upon the matter, and that the whole buſineſs might be reſolved among them. That <hi>Teſmund</hi> (for ſo he was now called, who e'rewhile was <hi>Greenwell</hi>) and he, did not long agone conſult together in <hi>Eſſex</hi> of the Particulars of this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31919:49"/> Conſpiracy. Laſtly, when <hi>Greenwell</hi> asked who ſhould be Protector of the Kingdom; <hi>Garnet</hi> anſwered, that that anſwer ought to be deferred till they ſaw how things ſhould go.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When theſe things were brought to his remembrance, and did make it appear that he knew of the Conſpiracy otherwiſe then by the way of Confeſſion, all that he anſwered was, that whatſoever he had ſigned with his own hand, was true.</p>
                  <p>Being <hi>brought to Execution</hi> the Third of <hi>May</hi> being <hi>Inventio crucis [Holy rood day]</hi> he ſaid, <q>he came thither that day to find an end at length of all the croſſes that he had born in this life; that none were ignorant of the cauſe of his puniſhment; that he had ſinned againſt the King in concealing it; that he was ſorry for it, and humbly begged the Kings Pardon: that the Plot againſt the King and Kingdom was bloody, and which if it had taken effect he ſhould have deteſted with all his heart, and that ſo horrid and inhumane a Fact ſhould be attempted by Catholicks, was that that grieved him more then his death.</q> Then he added many things in defence of <hi>Anne Vaux,</hi> who was held in Priſon, and <hi>lay under great ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> upon his account.</p>
                  <p>Being accuſed that he had while Q. <hi>Eliz.</hi> was alive recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved certain <hi>Breves</hi> from <hi>Rome,</hi>

                     </note> to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions ſubſcribed by him.</p>
                  <p>Being taxed for ſending <hi>Edmund Bainham</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> not to return to the City before the <hi>Plot ſhould take</hi> effect; This he thus excuſed, <q>as if he had not ſent him upon that account; but that he might inform the Pope of the calamitous ſtate of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and conſult with him what courſe the Catholicks ſhould take; and therefore referred them again to his Confeſſions.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:31919:50"/>
                  <p>Then he kneeled down upon the Stage <hi>to his Prayers,</hi> and looking about hither and thither, did ſeem to be diſtreſſed for the loſs of his life, and to hope a Pardon would be brought him from the moſt merciful Prince: <hi>Montacute</hi> admoniſhed him that he ſhould no longer think of life, but if he knew of <hi>any Treachery</hi> againſt the King or Kingdom, that he ſhould as a dying man preſently diſcover it; for that it was now no time to Equivocate. At which words <hi>Garnet</hi> being ſomewhat moved, made anſwer, <q>that he knew the time did not admit of <hi>Equivocation;</hi> that how far and when it is lawful to Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate he had otherwhere delivered his opinion, that now he did not equivocate, and that he knew nothing but what he had confeſſed.</q> Then he excuſed himſelf that he did <hi>at firſt diſſemble</hi> before the Lords; <q>That he did ſo becauſe he did not think they had had ſuch teſtimony and proof againſt him, till they did produce it; which when they did produce, he thought it as honourable for him to confeſs, as it would have been at firſt to have accuſed himſelf. He added many things to <hi>excuſe Greenwell,</hi> profeſſing that unleſs he thought he were out of danger, he would not have diſcovered the guilt of his dear Brother in this Conſpiracy.</q> Then praying that the<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <p>In his behalf <hi>Andreas Eudaimon-Johannes</hi> a <hi>Cretian,</hi> of the ſame Society, wrote an<note n="†" place="margin">

                     <hi>Apology, in anſwer to Sir</hi> Edw.

Moreover he doth endeavour to evince that <hi>Garnet</hi> never knew any thing of the Conſpiracy but by <hi>the way of</hi> Confeſſion; and that he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abhor the Treaſon.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:31919:50"/>
                  <p>Then ſome things are related of <hi>his Conſtancy at his Death,</hi> which are not related in the Hiſtory of it. And as a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his Commentary, there is the memorable <hi>Story of the Straw</hi> upon which the Effigies of the Dead was ſeen, at which he ſaith his Adverſaries were very much diſturbed.</p>
                  <p>Whiles the Body was quartered by the Hangman, ſome drops of blood fell upon the Straw that was there provided to light the fire. <hi>John Wilkinſon</hi> who was there preſent, that he might <hi>gather</hi> ſome relique of the Body of <hi>Garnet,</hi> carried home with him an Ear, that was ſprinkled with blood, and depoſited it with a Gentlewoman,<note place="margin">Hu. <hi>Wiſ.</hi>
                     </note> who kept it with great veneration in a Chriſtal-glaſs. Afterward it was obſerved with great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that the Effigies of <hi>Garnet</hi> was plainly expreſſed in that blood.</p>
                  <p>Then with great Zeal was the ſame of the Miracle ſpread abroad; which others did preſently elude by a contrary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; ſaying, <q>It ought to ſeem no wonder if a man brought up among Exiles in <hi>Flanders,</hi> improved at <hi>Rome</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> authorized to a Conſpiracy in his own Countrey, and breathing nothing but revenge, did as long as he lived thirſt after the blood of his Countreymen, ſhould when dead deſerve to be pictured in blood.</q> So dangerous a thing it is in theſe corrupt times to ſay any thing for the honour of any man in thoſe things which do exceed belief and the common courſe of Nature, which may not preſently be retorted to his diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement.</p>
                  <p>This end had <hi>this Conſpiracy;</hi> the ſtrangeſt that either our, or former ages do make mention of, for contrivance, daring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or cruelty. For it is often heard of, and fame doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it down to poſterity, that many Princes are cut off by Treachery, many Common-wealths are attempted by the ſnares and falſhood of their Enemies; But no Countrey, no Age ever bred ſuch a Monſter of Conſpiracy as this, wherein the King with the Queen, the Parents with their whole Iſſue, all the States of the Kingdom, the whole Kingdom it ſelf, and in it innumerable Innocents ſhould all be deſtined to one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in one moment, for a Sacrifice to the luſt of a few enraged Minds.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:31919:51"/>
                  <p>But it was very well, that that Monſter, which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that bear the blame of it, do both by word and writing every where deteſt, being ſo long before conceived at home, ſhould be ſtrangled in the birth before ever it ſee the light.</p>
                  <p>A little while after, <hi>Iſaac Caſaubon</hi> when he went into <hi>England,</hi> thinking of nothing leſs than to be engaged in this buſineſs, upon occaſion of <hi>another Apology</hi> ſent to him, and by him delivered to the King of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> wrote an Elegant <hi>Epiſtle to Fronto Ducaeus,</hi> in which he ſheweth, that <hi>Garnet</hi> knew otherwiſe then under the Seal of Confeſſion of the Powder Conſpiracy, by his own Confeſſion and Teſtimony written with his own hand, and doth at large diſcuſs the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Equivocation,</hi> as enſnaring and pernicious, againſt the Arguments of <hi>Eudaimon-Johannes.</hi> Againſt which, not <hi>Ducaeus,</hi> but <hi>Eudaimon-Johannes</hi> doth rail ſufficiently.</p>

                     <hi>TO THE READER. An Account of the</hi> Occaſion, Matter, Method and Manner of Writing of the Diſcourſe <hi>annexed</hi> with the Reaſons <hi>of it.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>THE <hi>Narration of the Gun-powder Treaſon</hi> by Thuanus being commended to me, after I had look'd into it, I perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a friend to tranſlate it into Engliſh, which being done, I gave it to the Book-ſeller to print, and for a <hi>Preface</hi> to it wrote the firſt Sect. of the Diſcourſe, not intending any more than that: which was printed, but not all the ſheets wrought off, when having met with that notable <hi>paſſage of Del Rio</hi> briefly cited in a Book lately printed, and peruſing the ſame more at large in Del Rio himſelf, I thought it worthy of further conſideration; and therefore ordered the Printer not to work off that Preface, but go on with the Tranſlation of Thuanus, and the while wrote ſo much of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Diſcourſe as concerns <hi>THE ORIGINAL OF THE POWDER-PLOT,</hi> that is to Sect. <hi>24;</hi> (though the whole Diſcourſe through want of timely notice to the Printer bears that <hi>Title);</hi> and that was all I then intended. But when I came to the concluſion of that part, I began to perceive that <hi>COMBINA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION OF ROME AND SPAIN AGAINST ENGLAND,</hi> which continued all the time of Queen Elizabeths Reign, and doth not a little confirm what had been ſaid in the former part of the Diſcourſe: and though I thought that the former part of the Diſcourſe did not ſtand much in need of confirmation from this, yet I thought it very pertinent and uſeful to ſhew that Combination in their various practices againſt that Queen, but as briefly as I could. This continues to Sect. <hi>37.</hi> nor did I then intend more. But reflecting upon the admirable Providence of God in preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that bleſſed Queen from ſo many and ſo various attempts againſt her, and in my turning over of Thuanus for the Story of the Combination having perceived ſomething of the unhappy
<pb facs="tcp:31919:53"/> iſſue of her Neighbours Perſecutions of the Profeſſors of that Reformed Religion which ſhe happily eſtabliſhed and defended, I began to perceive ſomething of that <hi>DISTINGUISHING PROVIDENCE,</hi> which is very Obſervable and Remarkable in the enſuing part of the Diſcourſe to Sect. <hi>61.</hi> Wherefore having curſorily run over ſome of the principal parts of that Story, and ſatisfied my ſelf that it would make good what I undertook; I thought it an unworthy piece of lazineſs or negligence not to add that part alſo, ſo pertinent, ſo remarkable and neceſſary; but hoped to have done it more briefly than I found I well could, when I again ſet my ſelf to the peruſal of the Hiſtory. Having finiſhed this, I made ſome Reflections upon the whole and thereupon added the <hi>OBSERVATIONS, Inferences</hi> and the reſt which make up the laſt part and concluſion, And this was the <hi>Occaſion,</hi> this the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of the Diſcourſe. Now for the <hi>Manner of writing it;</hi> when I began I was wholly a ſtranger to the Story, and to all or moſt of the Books I have made uſe of; had never read two leaves in Thuanus, ſave part of the Hiſtory of the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-Plot; had never ſeen Davila; had only occaſionally, if at all, looked into any other of Books I have made uſe of. Beſides being moſt of it written in the Countrey, and my own ſtock being but ſhort, I could not have that aſſiſtance from variety of Books which I deſired; and yet it pleaſed God many things fell in my way beyond my expectation; and <hi>the Authors</hi> I have generally uſed are ſuch whoſe Authority is beyond all exception, the incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable Thuanus, Davila, Perefix, and others of the Roman Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; for I have but rarely followed any Writers of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, and more rarely without the concurrent authority of others. But what is moſt conſiderable, the greateſt part being ſent away in ſingle ſheets by the Poſt as it was written, I could neither my ſelf have the peruſal of the entire work together, nor have it peruſed by my friends before it was printed. This I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for my excuſe of ſuch <hi>miſtakes</hi> as poſſibly may occur in it. For I did not deſign to injure the Truth in any particular, nor have I to my knowledg done it in any thing material; only Sect. <hi>12.</hi> you will meet with <hi>Lovain in Flanders,</hi> which perhaps is in Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant, though by Flanders I then meant than part of the Low-Countries
<pb facs="tcp:31919:53"/> which was then under the King of Spain or the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dukes Obedience; and I know the name Flanders is uſed in as large a ſenſe by many, and commonly by the Italians, and Sect. <hi>34.</hi> pag. <hi>48.</hi> 'tis ſaid, <hi>he made them amends for it afterwards,</hi> whereas that excommunication there mentioned was before, which I did not then obſerve when I wrote it. Again Sect. <hi>42.</hi> pag. <hi>74.</hi> you'l find, the D. of Tuſcany [Father to the Qu: Mother] which is a miſtake; for he was of the ſame Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and ſucceeded her Brother, but was not her Father; and therefore the Reader may either amend it, or quite ſtrike it out. But theſe are ſuch miſtakes as are rarely eſcaped by thoſe who write at more leiſure, and are no prejudice at all the Story. If any other miſtake that is material ſhall come to my knowledge, whether by my own obſervation, or the information of any other, whether friend or foe, I will not fail, God willing publickly to acknowledge the ſame, and if this diſcourſe ſhall be thought worthy of another Edition, to reform it. For I approve not the uſe of <hi>Piae Fraudes,</hi> and think Lying and Slandering, as always unlawful and unworthy of a Chriſtian; ſo where matters of Religion are concerned, to be prophane and ſacrilegious. The God of Truth is able to defend his own cauſe, the Truth, without ſuch wicked ſhifts; and when be pleaſeth to ſuffer it to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed for a time; he doth with great wiſdom permit it; but in the mean time allows not us to vindicate it by ſuch indirect means whereby we do, as much as in us lyes, oppoſe the deſign and courſe of his Providence. <hi>Numquid Deus indiget veſtro mendacio, ut pro illo loquamini dolos?</hi> Job. <hi>13.7.</hi> But if my haſt hath made me in any thing through miſtake to miſ-repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent any actions of the Papiſts to their prejudice, it is likely it hath made me overlook as much more which might have been ſaid againſt them. Nor have I thereby ſo much injured them, as they have injured themſelves and their cauſe by ſuch indirect and wicked practiſes as are beyond all contradiction, to the great ſcandal of the moſt Holy Chriſtian Religion; which is that which in ſome places hath made my expreſſions more ſharp than what otherwiſe I ſhould have uſed. Nor had it not been for that, and for the great danger I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend our Country to be in by their reſtleſs myſterious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices
<pb facs="tcp:31919:54"/> for the diſcovery and prevention whereof, the diſcovery of their former Policies and Practices may be of good uſe, ſhould I have delighted in ſuch an undertaking. I have otherwiſe no prejudice againſt them, and could heartily wiſh that all which I have written had been falſe; but ſince it is not only too true, but we are ſtill in danger from the ſame principles, though the manner and method of their operation and practice, may in ſome reſpects be altered, I cannot but think the undertaking both lawful and neceſſary. Nor is the honour of Religion ever a whit ſecured by palliating the irreligious practices of ſpurious Profeſſors; but better vindicated by publickly detecting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning; and, where there is a juſt Authority, condignly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing or correcting them. This is more agreeable to the will of God, and the courſe and methods of his Providence, who uſeth not to diſſemble the moſt ſecret miſcarriages of his deareſt chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but either to detect them, and bring them to light, to the end they may be puniſhed by the Miniſters of his Juſtice; or, if they, through want of knowledge, power, or fidelity, do fail therein, to do it himſelf by his Divine Judgments upon the offenders, unleſs they prevent the ſame by timely and ſeriouſly judging themſelves. But ſtill it may be objected; but why ſuch haſte? If it muſt be publiſhed, why not upon more mature deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration? Why not the Errata though never ſo inconſiderable firſt corrected? and perhaps, why not the ſtile firſt better ſmoothed and poliſhed, and ſome things removed to their proper places? I anſwer, If we muſt ſtay till we can be ſecure againſt all mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes, we ſhould have very few books ever publiſhed; but it is ſufficient if we can be ſecure for the main, whereof I am very well ſatisfyed as to this work; and for the ſtile and ornaments, which moſt concern my ſelf, they were not <hi>tanti</hi> with me, who neither undertook it, nor proceeded in it upon ſelf-reſpect: but beſides, I was beyond my firſt intention ingaged in it, and the Preſs was at work and being ſo engaged, I endeavoured to have kept pace with it, if I could; though I had before little thoughts of ever appearing in Print, and much diſliked that precipitate way of writing books, which by Fortius Ringel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergius is recommended to his Students, and do ſtill diſlike it, unleſs upon ſpecial occaſion. And indeed that which was a
<pb facs="tcp:31919:54"/> ſpecial motive and incitement to me to haſten it what I could, was the conſideration of the forwardneſs, activity and buſie practices of the Popiſh Emiſſaries and Agents, and of ſome others influenced by them further than they themſelves are aware of, and the dangerous conſequence thereof not only to the ſubverſion of the reformed Religion, and the Scandal of Chriſtianity it ſelf; but alſo to the ſubverſion of our Goverment, as the moſt effectual method for promoting their deſigns, and diſturbance of the Peace of the Kingdom. But theſe things I have touched toward the end of the Diſcourſe, and therefore ſhall add no more here, but only deſire the Readers favour to correct ſome of the more material errors of the Preſs, as is here after directed, and to bear with the reſt:</p>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:31919:56"/> days againſt her, but upon further conſideration of her age, not likely, according to the courſe of nature, to live long, deferred till the coming in of King <hi>James.</hi> In the mean time it may be remembred what is often ſeen in Judicatories and <hi>Tryals of Cauſes</hi> both Civil and Criminal, that thoſe things and works of darkneſs which are carried on and managed with ſo much ſecrecy and caution, that no <hi>direct proof</hi> can be made againſt them, are notwithſtanding often diſcovered and brought to light by a heedful and circumſpect obſervation and comparing of <hi>circumſtances:</hi> inſomuch, that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the truth, which is by this means made out, is not ſeldom more ſatisfactory to all preſent, than the direct and expreſs proof and teſtimonies of witneſſes, which many times prove falſe, even then when they ſeem to be moſt full and punctual. And therefore to prove this contrivance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded <hi>from other heads than</hi> Catesby<hi>'s alone</hi> and was <hi>of longer ſtanding</hi> than hath been commonly thought, what is yet want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in direct proofs, may in ſome meaſure be made up by the conſideration of the following Circumſtances.</p>

                     <hi>Whether a Prieſt may at any time make uſe of the diſcovery, which he hath made from Confeſſion, ſo much as for government and the averting of imminent evils?</hi> which he illuſtrates with this Inſtance, <hi>A Malefactor</hi> [Maleficus] <hi>confeſſes that himſelf or ſome other hath put Powder or ſomething elſe under ſuch an entry (or groundſel,) and except it be taken away the houſe will be burnt, the Prince deſtroyed, and as many as go into or out of the City will come to great miſchief or hazard;</hi> and then for ſome reaſons reſolves for the Negative, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the common ſenſe and opinion of almoſt all the Doctors, as he there acknowledgeth,) whereof this is one, <hi>viz. becauſe</hi> Pope <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. <hi>by his decree had command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Superiors of the Regulars to be moſt diligently cautious that they ſhould not make uſe of that knowledge of ſins, which they had by confeſſion for exterior government: which ſhews</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that the Pope doth moſt approve that opinion, which will have Confeſſors ſo to carry themſelves, as if they had heard nothing at all in confeſſion.</hi> At length from this Doctrine he draws theſe Conſequences. The 1. to this purpoſe, <hi>If</hi> one Malefactor <hi>confeſſing, among the circumſtances of his ſin, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his partner</hi> (in it,) <hi>and the other alſo preſently</hi> comes and <hi>confeſſes, but conceals that ſin wherein he was partner with the other, the Confeſſor may not uſe this knowledge to examine him concerning that ſin</hi> (which his partner hath confeſſed.) The 2. is, <hi>That a Prieſt may not, no, not for fear of death threatned him, reveal this crime to any one; and that in that caſe he may ſay that he knows not, nor hath heard any thing of ſuch ſin; becauſe in truth he doth not know, nor hath heard it, as</hi> (he is) <hi>a man, or as a member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> (but as a Prieſt.) <hi>Yea, he might ſay that he hath not heard it in Confeſſion, or that the accuſed perſon hath not confeſſed this to him, if he do</hi> but the while <hi>think in his mind,</hi> (viz. <hi>ſo, that I may reveal it;) and all theſe he may confirm upon Oath. Nor may the Prieſt be compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veal it by any one, no not by the Pope, much leſs by any other.</hi> This paſſage hath ſo many <hi>ſuſpicious circumſtances</hi> both in it and concurring with it, as all together may be equivalent to a full and direct proof of what is ſaid, that <hi>Del Rio</hi> was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:31919:58"/> privy to the contrivuance of this horrible Powder Plot, if not himſelf the Contriver of it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. For 1. if we conſider the <hi>Nature of the Inſtance,</hi> nothing could have been better <hi>fitted to expreſs this plot</hi> of blowing up the Prince and People together; more <hi>agreeing in all parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars;</hi> by burning a houſe, not firing a City; deſtroying Prince and People, King and Parliament, not the Prince a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, or alſo with his family and houſhold only; by pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, not by poiſon, aſſaſination, or open rebellion; by laying it under a houſe, not under a bed as <hi>Moody</hi> propoſed: and all this in ſo <hi>unuſual and extraordinary</hi> a caſe, when inſtances enow and miſchievous enough might have been given of more ordinary and uſual deſigns, and when he had <hi>other Doctors</hi> who write concerning the ſame queſtion under his conſideration, who muſt needs have put other inſtances into his mind, had not this been ſtudied by him, and here made uſe of upon deſign. If any of thoſe Doctors whom he there cites give any ſuch inſtance, he may reaſonably be abſolved from all ſuſpicion which otherwiſe will lie very heavy upon him.

Nor were they only the heads of the Pope and Grandees at <hi>Rome</hi> and other places, who were buſie and active at that time in contriving projects and conſpiracies for the ſubverſion and ruine of our Government and Religion, but of perſons alſo of meaner quality, and they not only the Popiſh Incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries of our own Nation, but forreiners alſo of the Romiſh Faction. Thus we may obſerve <hi>Campanella's</hi> book <hi>de Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchia Hiſpanica</hi> exactly contemporary with this of <hi>Del Rio,</hi> as the Preface to the Engliſh Edition doth demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, <hi>viz.</hi> that it was written between the years 1599 &amp; 1600. In this book he ſhews in part, <hi>what Preparations may be made before hand; that ſo ſoon as ever Queen</hi> Elizabeth (<hi>who is now
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:31919:60"/> very old) is dead, they may be immediately put into Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Rouzing up and encouraging to action the Spirits of the Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks. 4.

But for <hi>the like</hi> what they may be, is left to the Readers judgement to conceive. Only it may be noted that he who would not ſcruple to cauſe and keep up Diſſentions, to ſow the ſeeds of a <hi>continual</hi> war, to excite Rebellions among us, would hardly have ſcrupled at ſuch a project, as by one blow would have put us quite out of our pain. It would be too long to note all the Projects of private men to this purpoſe, which were on foot at that time: but this of <hi>Campanella</hi> for the promotion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and deſigns of the King of <hi>Spain</hi> is the more pertinent and obſervable, becauſe our conſpirators had their Negotiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with him, their <hi>Leger</hi> there, and built their greateſt hopes upon his aſſiſtance at the ſame time.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. But there is an <hi>other particular,</hi> as to this circumſtance of Time, very conſiderable, which is intimated to us in thoſe words of <hi>Campanella.</hi> For as we may eaſily perceive many heads at work at this time, many projects on foot contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary in the contrivance; ſo do they all agree in <hi>the Time deſigned for Execution.</hi> So <hi>Campanella's</hi> Preparations, <hi>ſo ſoon as ever Queen</hi> Elizabeth <hi>is dead, are immediately to be put in Execution.</hi> So Pope <hi>Clements</hi> Bulls had reſpect to the ſame time, <hi>Quandocun<expan>

                     <hi>appeared both againſt the Catholick King in the Low-Countries, and againſt the moſt Chriſtian King in</hi> France, <hi>aſſiſting the Hereticks both with her Counſels and Forces,</hi> what will <hi>Great Britain</hi> do, when not only the occaſion of thoſe wars ſhall ceaſe, but both Nations be united under one and the ſame King? No queſtion but the forethoughts of this ſet wiſer heads on work than <hi>Catesbys,</hi> or any other of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Gentlemen, who are vainly pretended to have been trapan'd by <hi>Cecil;</hi> and ſomething no doubt was reſolved up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>the time drawing on, and the Queen very old.</hi> And this might be the reaſon of their long expectation, <hi>that change of State, would change Religion,</hi> alſo (<hi>Speed ſect.</hi> 37.) And if we conſider the Principles and practiſes of theſe men, and what before had been attempted againſt the late Queen, not only by open Hoſtility, as becomes Kings and States where they have juſt cauſe, but alſo by baſe ſecret conſpiracies and treacheries againſt her perſon, inſtigated and fomented, as well by other Princes and by their Embaſſadors, even whilſt Legers here (as <hi>Mendoza</hi> and <hi>Labeſpineus,</hi>) as by the Pope, we can hardly think any thing ſo baſe or barbarous that they were not like to attempt upon <hi>this</hi> occaſion. And if we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain conſider, how all their former endeavours, whether more juſtifyable before men, as by open hoſtility, or more baſe and unworthy, not only by promoting rebellions, but alſo by poiſon &amp; aſſaſination, had hitherto been ineffectual and defeated, we may not unreaſonably think that they might at laſt arrive at ſome ſuch project as this, as their laſt refuge and moſt effectual and infallible means to accompliſh at laſt their ſo long ſtudied deſigns. And laſtly that it really was ſo, the punctual obſervance both of <hi>Campanella</hi>'s preparations, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to alienate affections and raiſe jealouſies between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> and other differences and diſſentions
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:31919:61"/> among us and ſtirring up the ſpirits of the Engliſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which were practiſed immediately upon the Queens death and the Kings coming to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> (and have ever ſince been proſecuted) too long here to be related, and alſo of <hi>Del Rio</hi>'s Inſtance, and Doctrine of Concealing Confeſſions, and that by Equivocation even in examination upon Oath, ſo well fitted to this purpoſe, and as well and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly followed and proſecuted, may reaſonably incline us to believe. This circumſtance of the time deſigned for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of this Plot is alſo viſible in <hi>Catesby</hi>'s <hi>Reaſonings</hi> (ſee the <hi>Hiſt. pag.</hi> 4.5.) which he might well learn from the ſame Tutors from whom he learnt the project of the Plot it ſelf; for if to take off King <hi>James</hi> alone, unleſs alſo the Prince, the Duke, and moreover the Peers and whole Parliament, would not ſerve their turn, much leſs would it have ſerved, to have taken off Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (now ready to die of her ſelf) though with her Parliament, while the King, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the addition of another Nation to this, was ready to ſucceed her.</p>
                  <p n="11">11.

But before we follow the trace further, if any one ſhould here make this queſtion <hi>Why they had not prepared their mine againſt the firſt ſitting of the Parliament?</hi> though we might well content our ſelves with this anſwer, that it may be ſufficient in all reaſon to ſatisfie us and them too, that we have this evidence, that the project was then on foot, and that many accidents might unexpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly intervene, which might though unknown to us, move them for ſome time to defer their preparations, as, even after it was begun, <hi>Thuanus</hi> tells us, that the work was often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitted and often repeated, and we find that by ſuch an accident as the <hi>Scotch</hi> Lords ſitting at <hi>Percy</hi>'s houſe,<note place="margin">

But when the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being well-pleaſed for his own part with the proceedings of the Treatie, fell off from his former promiſes of aſſiſtance, and their Petition was rejected at home, they preſently conclude that a deſperate diſeaſe muſt have a deſperate remedy, and in order thereunto,<note place="margin">V.

                     <hi>Catesby begins to broach the project,</hi> which againſt this time had been kept ſecret in ſtore, and imparts it to ſome of his moſt truſty confidents; who thereupon might probably think that it was of his contrivance, as others from thence have ſince thought it to have been; and that the rather, becauſe in all their dealings preceding this, even to the firſt intimation of it
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:31919:62"/> by <hi>Del Rio,</hi> nothing viſible did appear as to thoſe conſpirators in particular, but only Negotiations with <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> for forrein aſſiſtances, and an invaſion; which wiſer heads upon the conſideration of the former ill ſucceſſes of ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts could not think of it ſelf ſufficient; and therefore we may more reaſonably believe that they who ſecretly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhand managed the buſineſs, ſo ordered theſe Negotiations as well for a blind to conceal the main deſign, as for a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary means to ſecond it, when it had once taken effect. But beſides theſe Negotiations abroad, we find other matters at home in agitation, by perſons of the ſame party, to wit the Jeſuites in general. For <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> two Prieſts who were apprehended <hi>July</hi> 1603. before the King was crowned, for another plot of a lower rate and more ordinary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in <hi>their Confeſſions</hi> upon their apprehenſion, affirmed <q>that there was ſome treaſon intended by the Jeſuites, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to them, by their proviſions of Money, Arms and Ammunition, diſſwading the Catholicks from acceptance of the King at his firſt coming, (but withal) <hi>wiſhing them not to ſtir, but keep themſelves quiet, till they heard from them.</hi>
                     </q> (<hi>Proceed. K.</hi> 3.) Of this, <hi>Caſaubon,</hi> who had peruſed their Confeſſions, writeth thus to <hi>Fronto Duraeus</hi> in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle dated 7 <hi>Novem.

They ſaid, and often and conſtantly affirmed, that when they communicated their counſels to the Jeſuites then living in <hi>England,</hi> and deſired them that they would be partakers with them of ſo noble an enterpriſe, they received this anſwer, that the Jeſuites could not joyn with them;</q> foraſmuch<note n="*" place="margin">Ut qui ſuam quo<expan>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:31919:62"/> in all theſe projects contemporary with <hi>Del Rio</hi>'s Inſtance, and ſufficiently ſhew us that ſome firſt motions towards the execution of this plot were then on foot, though the more plain and downright preparations, were for ſome ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as aboveſaid for ſome time deferred, and ſometimes, it may be, adjourned for want of fit opportunity. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſince <hi>Del Rio</hi>'s inſtance is contemporary with theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and this enterpriſe of the Powder Plot with the time deſigned in them for execution, we may very reaſonably think that he gave an inſtance of that which was then as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deſigned as it was now punctually practiſed, ſaving only that little diſtorting of it to the ſubject of his book, which does but make it the more ſuſpicious.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. And that we may ſee that there is no circumſtance but doth, not only well agree with this conjecture, but ſome way or other help to confirm it, we may alſo take notice of <hi>the Place, where this book of</hi> Del Rio<hi>'s was written and firſt Printed, viz. Lovane,</hi> in <hi>Flanders;</hi> where theſe Conſpirators had Father <hi>Baldwin,</hi> a Jeſuite, Leger, and others of their confederates, as Sir <hi>William Stanly</hi> and <hi>Owen,</hi> Reſident; whither they had often recourſe, and from whence they expected their moſt preſent help after the blow ſhould be given. So that it was not hard for them to meet with ſome intimation among their frequent conſultations about theſe matters there, in <hi>Flanders,</hi> of ſome ſuch notable and moſt effectual project, not only by means of this book there pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but even from the Author himſelf, or the Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bators of it their correſpondents. And of <hi>Catesby</hi> in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, upon whom this contrivance is father'd, that he held correſpondence there, is plain enough; ſo likewiſe of <hi>Garnet,</hi> who was afterward had in that eſteem at <hi>Lovane,</hi> that it was once publickly prayed there, — <hi>Sanctae Henrice, Ora pro nobis (Foul. l.</hi> 10. <hi>c.</hi> 10. <hi>ſub fin)</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="13">13. Now if from the conſideration of the book, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further to <hi>the conſideration of the Author,</hi> we ſhall find all circumſtances ſtill concur to the confirmation of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. 1. One of the Society of the Jeſuites, into which he was admitted, <hi>Ann.</hi> 1580. and who about the time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:31919:63"/> this book became the Popes ſworn Servant, <hi>quatuor jam votis ſolemnibus obſtrictus,</hi> being obliged not only by thoſe three vows, Common to all the Religious Orders, but moreover by that fourth peculiar to that Society, of ſpecial obedience to the Pope. 2. Of that height of zeal againſt He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, that at the very mention or leaſt remembrance of them in common diſcourſe, he would change colour and his ſtomach riſe againſt them. 3. Before he entred into the Society, he had been one of the chief Senate of <hi>Brabant,</hi> then Chanceller of <hi>Brabant,</hi> and had the management of the Kings Exchequer. (<hi>Phil. Alegambe</hi> in <hi>Biblioth.</hi>) 4. And being firſt well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by theſe employments, and then ſufficiently inſtructed in the Jeſuites Society, he at length became a Politician, and had his projects and deviſes for an Innovation to be made both in Church and State throughout the whole <hi>Romane</hi> Empire, which the Jeſuites earneſtly endeavoured to put in practiſe; the ſumm whereof, as they are related from his own mouth by <hi>William Freake</hi> of the Practice of the Jeſuites, <hi>pag.</hi> 58. were, <q>to raiſe ſuch diviſions and differences among the Princes of the Empire, by working upon their contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of opinions in matters of Religion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they may waſt and weaken themſelves one againſt another, that their ſtrength and power may be broken, or at leaſt weakened, and become utterly unable to withſtand a common foe, when he ſhall come upon them.</q> Where he ſets down more particularly how differences may be raiſed between ſuch and ſuch particular Princes. Laſtly, his Opinion and Judgment of this Gunpowder Plot, may in ſome ſort be underſtood by his eſteem of <hi>Garnet,</hi> whom he<note n="*" place="margin">

Baldwin</hi> and divers others of the Engliſh Fugitives of the better quality: Laſtly, <hi>at</hi> Rome <hi>with the Engliſh Aſſiſtant there</hi> F. Parſons, whom we may conclude to have had particular knowledge of this deſign, not only from what he wrote concerning the Journey or Pilgrimage to S. <hi>Winefreds-well,</hi> &amp; the myſtical prayer which he ordered his Students to uſe, to ſay nothing of the many projects which his working brain continually deviſed, and his furious zeal as earneſtly urged and proſecuted, or of his Letter wherein he wrote (<hi>Anno</hi> 1600.) that he had then been ten years dealing in ſuch matters; but we are moreover given to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand ſo much from ſome of his own Religion, though <q>not of his Order, and that he was highly acceſſory to it, both before and after the diſcovery, as might be proved by
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:31919:64"/> great and manifeſt inſtances.</q> (The Jeſuites Reaſons unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, <hi>Doubt</hi> 1.) But for his Correſpondence at <hi>Rome,</hi> we need do no more but firſt remember who <hi>Garnet</hi> was, <hi>viz.</hi> Provincial of the Engliſh Jeſuites, and then reflect upon the continual weekly or <hi>octiduan</hi> Intelligences, which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincials from all parts conſtantly tranſmit, concerning all matters of moment, to their ſeveral reſpective Aſſiſtants at <hi>Rome,</hi> who immediately impart the ſame to the F. General of the whole Society, always Reſident there, and he or they, as the matter requires or deſerves, to the Pope: (of which the Diſcourſe of the Jeſuites Politicks, written under <hi>Paul</hi> v. Printed in the Myſt. of Jeſuit. <hi>part</hi> 2. and other Writers give us an account) and then we cannot doubt of his correſpondence there, not only with the Engliſh Aſſiſtant <hi>Parſons,</hi> but alſo, at leaſt by means of the Aſſiſtant, <hi>with the F. General</hi> Claudius Aquaviva, and <hi>with the Pope</hi> himſelf, and that in this very particular, being a matter of ſo great moment; which doth more particularly appear by the Bulls prepared to be ſent over hither, as ſoon as the plot had taken effect, and other inſtances not neceſſary here to be inſiſted on. So that if we conſider the Perſons and their Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondences and Intelligences, it will not be hard to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how eaſily this Plot, whereſoever or by whomſoever invented, might be communicated, if by <hi>Del Rio,</hi> to our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendians here; if by any of them, to him; if at <hi>Rome,</hi> both to him and to them, or, for the more ſecret conveyance of the notice of it, from thence, by him, to them. Which is not unlikely that it was, and that it was the contrivance of F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> who at that time, <hi>Anno</hi> 1600, had been ten years dealing in ſuch matters, and ſtudying and promoting projects againſt his Country, as we may perceive by his aforeſaid letter then written.</p>
                  <p n="16">16. Laſtly, if from the Actors we come to conſider <hi>their Actions and Management</hi> of the whole buſineſs, we ſhall find a wonderful agreement, from firſt to laſt, in all the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, not one croſſing or thwarting our conjecture, not one failing, not one that doth not afford ſome matter or ground to confirm it. For 1. If we conſider the whole
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:31919:65"/> 
                     <hi>Section of</hi> Del Rio, and <hi>with</hi> it compare <hi>the Actions and carriage of the Conſpirators,</hi> in all, there is ſo punctual an agreement, that without further proof, it ſeems to own and bewray its parent, being as like him, as if (according to our proverb) it was ſpat out of his mouth; at leaſt to diſcover that it was nearly related to him. Thus with his Inſtance agree the undertakings of the Conſpirators; with his Doctrine of not revealing things diſcovered in Confeſſion, though the moſt hainous Treaſons and moſt pernitious to the State, the Practice of their Confeſſors; with his means for concealing the ſame by Equivocation, and Confirmation thereof by Oath or moſt ſolemn proteſtations, their punctual, ſtrict and reſolute uſe and obſervance thereof. All which is ſo plain and manifeſt from what is before recited out of that Section, and obſerved in it, and from the following Hiſtory, and the Proceedings againſt the Traytors, that nothing more need be alledged to prove it, as nothing can be ſaid with any colour of probability to diſprove it.</p>
                  <p n="17">17. And therefore 2. We may alſo, as to their Actions, take notice of the great <hi>Care</hi> and <hi>Caution</hi> and <hi>Secrecy,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with their Jugling indirect Practiſes, wherewith they managed their buſineſs; and that in theſe two reſpects: 2. in general <hi>for the better ſecuring of their deſign and undertakings from diſcovery.</hi> And this appears in <hi>divers Inſtances,</hi> as 1. In <hi>Th. Winters Dealing,</hi> firſt with Sir <hi>William Stanly,</hi> to whom, though a good friend to the Catholick Cauſe, he poſitively affirmed that there was no reſolution to ſet any project a foot in <hi>England;</hi> as he tells us in his Confeſſion: then with <hi>Fawkes,</hi> to whom though ſent for by him to act in this tragedy, he imparted only a reſolution of a practiſe in general againſt his Majeſty for relief of the Catholick Cauſe, as appears by both their Confeſſions. 2. In that the buſineſs was very ſparingly <hi>communicated,</hi> at firſt <hi>but to few,</hi> and afterwards to more as the intended time of Execution drew on, and <hi>under an Oath of Secrecy,</hi> in the moſt ſolemn manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, by receiving the Sacrament upon it. And <hi>Garnet</hi> himſelf <hi>often religiouſly proteſted to them both by word and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that he would never betray them,</hi> in his Letter dated on
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:31919:65"/> Palm-Sunday (<hi>Tortura torti, pag.</hi> 286.) which implyes that he was often thereunto urged by them. 3. In that <hi>reaſon which</hi> Catesby <hi>alledged,</hi> when he deſired leave to acquaint ſome others with the buſineſs: for <hi>many,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>may be content that I ſhould know, who would not therefore that all the company ſhould be acquainted with their names,</hi> as it is in <hi>Winters</hi> Confeſſion; and it is not unlikely that he learnt this reaſon by experience at the ſame time and from the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as he did the contrivance it ſelf; which might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for the more ſecrecy, be thus conveyed to him, through divers intermediate hands, from the firſt Author or Authors of it.</p>
                  <p n="18">18. And 2. more eſpecially, <hi>for ſecuring the reputation of the Society,</hi> in caſe the Plot ſhould be detected: and this appears in the Actions and indirect Practiſes both of the Jeſuites, and of the other Conſpirators. Hence it was that <hi>Garnet the Provincial,</hi> being of greateſt Authority, and therefore likely to bring moſt Diſcredit and greateſt Odium upon the Society, if ſuch a man as he ſhould be diſcovered to have any hand in ſo foul and infamous a matter, <hi>at firſt</hi> would not be known even to <hi>Catesby</hi> himſelf, the principal viſible actor in the Plot, or to any other, but of his own Order, that he was made privy to it. And <hi>after the Diſcovery</hi> of the Plot, how ſollicitous was he, and concern'd for the whole Society! <hi>At at, actum eſt de Societate;</hi> which he feared would ſuffer for it, as being conſcious they well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. Then upon his <hi>Examination and Tryal,</hi> how ready and dexterous was he with his Equivocations, and deſperately impious in ſtiff Denyals, upon his Soul, and with deteſtable Execrations, of thoſe very things which were after ſo mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly proved againſt him, that he could not longer deny them! And for <hi>the other Conſpirators:</hi> 1. They <hi>taxed none in Holy Orders,</hi> which many looked upon, ſays <hi>Thuanus,</hi> as purpoſely avoided, becauſe they were <hi>bound by Oath not to do it.</hi> And certainly, <hi>Garnet,</hi> when he ſo often engaged not to betray them, would not be leſs careful for the Society, to oblige them not to diſcover any of it. 2. Nor did they only carefully abſtain from accuſing, but moſt deſperately <hi>indeavoured
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:31919:66"/> by all means,</hi> even the worſt of means, by lyes and falſe proteſtations <hi>to excuſe them.</hi> Such were Digbys <hi>Proteſtations,</hi> whereupon the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> obſerved, <hi>what faith was to be given to theſe mens proteſtations, who ſought to excuſe all Jeſuits how foul ſoever, out of an opinion that it is merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſo to do, at ſuch time as they had no hope of themſelves, and to clear them of thoſe practiſes which they themſelves have now confeſſed</hi> ex proprio ore. Such was alſo that lamentable <hi>attempt of Treſham</hi> upon his death-bed to excuſe <hi>Garnet,</hi> wherein he was diſproved, by the Confeſſions both of Mrs <hi>Vaux, Garnets</hi> intimate, and of <hi>Garnet</hi> himſelf. To theſe may be added, Their <hi>Deſign to have father'd</hi> the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe <hi>upon the Puritans;</hi> and ſince, Their impudent ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Imputation</hi> of the Original <hi>of it to</hi> Cecil: which makes the relation of that deſign more credible; and that again makes this imputation more apparently void of Credit.</p>
                  <p n="19">19. Now of theſe Obſervations of their Secrecy and Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe we may reaſonably make <hi>this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe:</hi> 1. To manifeſt <hi>the validity and Sufficiency of theſe and ſuch like Arguments</hi> and Proofs, from Circumſtances and by way of Inducement, in this caſe. For where ſuch Works of Darkneſs, as to the main ſubſtance of them are plainly and fully proved, and as plainly and evidently proved to have been managed with ſo much Secrecy and Practiſe, we cannot reaſonably expect greater Proof and Evidence of any Circumſtance belonging to them, than ſo plain a concurrence and agreement of all other Circumſtances with it. 2. To manifeſt <hi>the Inſufficiency of what ever ſhould he urged from their Confeſſions againſt us.</hi> For ſince they did not only ſtifly deny plain truths, but alſo muſt impudently affirm manifeſt falſhoods, eſpecially where it was thought neceſſary for excuſing any of the Society, what ever ſhall be alledged from their ſpeeches for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe may reaſonably be ſuſpected to have been fained and deviſed for that end, and deſerves no credit at all. 3. <hi>To Anſwer the Objection</hi> that might be made, <hi>and Correct the Miſtake</hi> that hath been committed, <hi>concerning the firſt Author and Original</hi> of the Plot, as if it was at firſt of <hi>Catesby's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:31919:66"/> and not till their Deſpair of Aſſiſtance from <hi>Spain,</hi> upon their laſt Negotiation there.</p>
                  <p n="20">20. To which it might be <hi>Anſwered, from their Practiſe</hi> to excuſe their Complices eſpecially the Jeſuits, that they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed the Contrivance to <hi>Catesby,</hi> becauſe he being dead could accuſe no other, and aſſigned That Time, as being a good probable Occaſion of it. But 2. It may be Anſwered, perhaps more ſatisfactorily and fully, <hi>From their Secrecy,</hi> and from <hi>Catesby's</hi> own words, that ſome might be willing to be known to him, who would not be known to the reſt to be privy; and the rather becauſe this was an old policy formerly practiſed in order to the Spaniſh Invaſion; which was after attempted in 88. when many were ſo cunningly engaged that they knew not of, and ſo were not able to accuſe any, but the perſon that ingaged them, (as Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in his Obſervations upon the Libel publiſhed 1592. and in his Collection of the Felicities of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> ſhews from a Letter of one of their Principal Heads, which was intercepted;) and not only practiſed before, but alſo repeated immediatly after this Plot, when Five had ſeveral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly undertaken the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi>'s death, and vowed the performance of it; and yet it was ſo ordered that none of thoſe Five knew who the other Four were, for the better preventing the diſcovery of the reſt, if any one by attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and not performing ſhould be apprehended; from hence it may well be anſwered: That it is very probable, that <hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Fawkes,</hi> from whoſe Confeſſions this miſtake hath ariſen, and the Objection may be made, and moſt of the other Conſpirators, did indeed know of no other Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Contrivance, but <hi>Catesby.</hi> And yet it may ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well be, that He received it from others the firſt Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of it, either immediately or mediately, either the full Project expreſly, with the Reaſons mentioned by <hi>Thuanus,</hi> under ſome Oath of Secrecy or Engagement not to diſcover from whom he received it, or at leaſt ſome ſuch Hints and Intimations of it, as were ſufficient to ſet on work a mind ſo active and well diſpoſed to improve the ſame to the utmoſt; and without any ſuch engagement, he might be apt enough
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:31919:67"/> to take the Invention upon himſelf; not only out of Devotion to the Society, whoſe reputation he might thereby the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſecure in caſe it ſhould miſcarry; but even out of an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to be reputed the Author of ſo Glorious an Enterpriſe. And that He ſhould be intruſted with ſo Great a Secret, and the Chief viſible Management of it, rather than any of the reſt, was very likely, 1. Becauſe he and his Family had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and devoted to the Jeſuits from their very firſt coming into <hi>England;</hi> and were harbourers of <hi>Campian,</hi> who with his Comrade <hi>Parſons</hi> (the two firſt and principal who were deſigned and employed for that Service) came into <hi>England Anno</hi> 1580. where he was apprehended 22. <hi>July</hi> in the year next enſuing; as we are informed by <hi>Sanders</hi> 3. <hi>de Schiſmate Anglicano.</hi> From which time it is not unlikely that he held correſpondence with F. <hi>Parſons,</hi> who ſoon after returned to <hi>Rome,</hi> and continued there Rector of the Engliſh Colledge, till ſome years after the diſcovery of this plot, <q>he was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turned out of <hi>Rome</hi> by Mounſieur <hi>Bethunes</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Embaſſadour, and Order from the King of <hi>France,</hi> being diſcovered to plot a new treaſon againſt his Majeſty, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Duke of <hi>Parma;</hi>
                     </q> as we are told by a Romaniſt. But 2. this was not all why <hi>Catesby</hi> was preferred before the reſt in this ſervice: for in this reſpect <hi>Treſham</hi> might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have claimed that honor, as well as he, as we may ſee in <hi>Sanders;</hi> but <hi>Catesby</hi> had another more ſpecial qualification, as being more Cautious and Cunning, as we may obſerve in <hi>Thuanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="21">21. But becauſe ſo plauſible a <hi>Pretenſe, for the Occaſion</hi> of theſe deſperate reſolutions at that time, as the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s then deſerting of the Conſpirators upon his Treaty of Peace with <hi>England,</hi> may ſeem to have ſome weight in it; though it muſt be noted, that this ſeemes rather to have been the Conjecture of the Hiſtorians and others, than that any ſuch thing was expreſly alledged by the Conſpirators, for ought appears in the Printed Confeſſions of <hi>Fawkes</hi> and <hi>Winter;</hi> yet that we may leave no ſcruple, and make it further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that we have not only the concurrence of all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to confirm our belief of the truth of what hath been
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:31919:67"/> ſaid, but have alſo ſufficient matter and ground for Anſwer to all Objections, we ſhall return ſuch <hi>Anſwer,</hi> though touch'd before, as may both ſufficiently ſolve this doubt, and be of ſome uſe to other purpoſe. And therefore it muſt be remembred, 1. That all the neighbouring Popiſh Princes, eſpecially <hi>France, Spain,</hi> and the Archdukes of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the latter end of the Queens Reign, were not a little concerned upon <hi>Fear of what Conſequence the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion of the three Kingdoms, (viz.</hi> of <hi>Scotland</hi> with <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland) might prove in time;</hi> as is not only apparent in it ſelf, but intimated to us by the Papiſts themſelves in their Supplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to King <hi>James</hi> before the diſcovery of this plot; and thereupon bent all their Conſultations, and uſed all Means to prevent or hinder it, as well after the Kings coming in, as before, and even by their Embaſſadours here, did not only tamper with ſome of the Prime Miniſters of State to corrupt them, but alſo practiſed to raiſe ſtirs and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Of the <hi>French, Cambden</hi> tells us that the <hi>French</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour ſtudied to move Commotions, <hi>ne duo diviſa Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanniae Regna, Angliae &amp; Scotiae, in unum coaleſcerent;</hi> and others inform us of his tampering with ſome of the Prime Stateſmen here. And of <hi>Count Arembergh,</hi> Embaſſadour Extraordinary for the Archdukes, we find him reported to have been an agent in the Treaſon of <hi>Watſon</hi> and <hi>Clark,</hi> and not only ſo, but that He and they were the Contrivers of it, and that He drew into it the Lord <hi>Cobham,</hi> and, by his means, his brother <hi>Brook, Parham,</hi> the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wilſon,</hi> and at length <hi>Raleigh</hi> alſo was brought in.</p>
                  <p n="22">22.

                  <p n="23">23. And to theſe pitiful and baſe unworthy Arts, did the Grave Spaniſh Counſels and high vaunts at laſt deſcend; and this was a fair Introduction to the Contrivance of this Maſter-piece and laſt refuge of the Powder-plot, which,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:31919:69"/> from what hath been ſaid before, we have great reaſon to believe did ſhortly after ſucceed. Now if theſe things be conſidered, and therewith the State and Condition of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi> at that time, which we may find well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to our hand by Sir <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> in his conſiderations touching a war with <hi>Spain,</hi> it muſt needs be a very weak and childiſh thing for any man to imagine that <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould have been ſo inconſiderate as to have had any thought of Invading <hi>England</hi> at that time, notwithſtanding any combination of whatſoever party ready to receive him here, of Papiſts and diſcontented perſons, (whereof he had made greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations againſt the Northern Rebellion and 88.) did he not build upon ſome ſuch myſtery of the Powder Plot. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we well examine the Preparations then made or deſigned both abroad and at home, we ſhall find them rather proportionable to ſecond ſome ſuch feat as this, when the King and the Nobility and a great part of the Gentry were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and the whole Kingdom under ſo great a conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confuſion as muſt there upon unavoidably have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, than otherwiſe to have atchieved any conqueſt of this Nation.

He had his Original, as himſelf uſed to glory, from an Illuſtrious Houſe; for, for want of Covering, it was in all parts illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the Sun-beams; being born of poor parents in a pittiful Cottage. But his good qualities were muſt conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous after his Election to the Papacy, being a moſt Imperious, Proud, Ambitious, Vain-glorious, Gluttonous, Covetous, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, Revengeful, Inhumane, and raſhly ſevere man, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries whereof, by a ſpecial faculty of Diſſimulation, he had before ſimulated, as he is deſcribed by <hi>Thuanus</hi> and <hi>Cicarella</hi> in his life. He began <hi>the exerciſe of his Authority</hi> with a raſh and unjuſt condemnation of <hi>a young man of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> to be hanged,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>83.</hi> Cica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. in vita.</note> for only refuſing in his Maſters houſe to deliver an Aſs to the Popes Officers, which was not his in whoſe name they demanded it, but the young mans maſter's, all men pittying the hard caſe of the poor fellow.

This I have related the more largely, becauſe hitherto the Proteſtants had been onely paſſive, that, ſince now they had engaged in Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as many of them did in this ſervice of the Prince, it may the better appear upon what grounds they did Act; which was not upon pretenſe of Religion, though no doubt that was a great motive to them, but for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Laws, and for the Liberty of their Prince and Lawful Governour, and againſt thoſe who did aſpire not to the Regency onely, but to the Crown and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it ſelf, by a long train of policies and violent Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties.

Nor was the Royal Authority abus'd to concur in this Iniquity and Injuſtice only by connivence and permiſſion of theſe things thus done by the Kings Miniſters and Officers
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:31919:90"/> in fraud and violation of the Agreement of Peace and the Edict made in Confirmation of it, but alſo to give further occaſion and countenance to it by divers <hi>fraudulent and elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory Interpretations of the Edict.</hi> By which means, whiles it ſeems, it was thought too groſs plainly and directly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke it, they did notwithſtanding indirectly elude its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and the benefit expected by it: in ſuch ſort, that had the Proteſtants been of thoſe pernitious principles, that their adverſaries indeed were, and endeavoured to repreſent them to be, the moſt ſubtile and malitious enemies of that Kingdom could not have deviſed and promoted a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means and method of its confuſion and ruine. And the truth is this was it, which the principal Authors and Fomenters of thoſe courſes, the <hi>Guiſes</hi> at home and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> abroad, aimed at, and by theſe means in conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to make themſelves Maſter of it. Which though at that time not ſo viſible to every one, yet was afterwards very apparent. The Pope alſo, becauſe <hi>France</hi> ſtood too much upon their Liberties and Priviledges, being a well wiſher to their deſigns, eſpecially of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> though not ſo much of <hi>Spain,</hi> as not deſiring ſo potent a Neighbour. But all theſe oppreſſions and Injuries though they provoked ſome little tumults of the vulgar, yet were they not ſufficient to produce and neceſſitate another Civil War, which not only the <hi>Spaniard</hi> deſired, as well for his own ſecurity to divert a War from himſelf, as in order to his further deſigns, but alſo the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> his Nephews now growing up, though his brother the Duke was ſlain; and therefore beſides theſe, other means were thought on to do that at leaſt, if they ſhould fail to make way for their ends, by taking off thoſe who moſt ſtood in their way. And to this purpoſe, beſides <hi>ſome leſſer Confederacies</hi> for an irreconcilable war againſt the Proteſtants, there was <hi>a Conſpiracy,</hi> which was begun indeed <hi>by the Duke of Guiſe</hi> in his life time, but renued again and carried on by the ſame faction, <hi>with the King of Spain,</hi> for the cutting off of thoſe of the Nobility who favored the Proteſtant doctrine, and particularly for ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:31919:91"/> the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> and her Children, (the next heirs to the Crown of <hi>France</hi> after the familie of <hi>Valois,</hi>) who were all children and in their power already) and clapping them into the Spaniſh Inquiſition. But this being diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> in receit to her mother the Queen mother of <hi>France,</hi> who eaſily perceived what was aimed at, and by others to the Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> and ſo prevented; the Legates of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Pope and <hi>Savoy</hi> were by the means of the Cardinal of <hi>Lorain,</hi> ſent to perſwade the King to admit the Councel of <hi>Trent</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and to that end to invite him to a <hi>Conſultation of the Catholick Princes at</hi> Nancie <hi>in</hi> Lorain, to enter into a Holy League for the extirpation of the Hereticks, but the Queen mother nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liking the admiſſion of the Councel, nor to engage ſo openly againſt the Proteſtants, the Legates were under ſome other pretenſes diſmiſſed. Wherefore the next year, the King being declared out of his Minority, and with his Mother making a progreſs through all parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, an Enterview between them and the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> accompanied with the Duke of <hi>Alva</hi> is ſo ordered that <hi>a more ſecret Conſultation</hi> is held at <hi>Bayonne</hi> for the extirpation of the hereticks,<note place="margin">Jan. 1565. <hi>Davila. l.</hi> 3. <hi>Thu. l.</hi> 37.</note> and a Holy League made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Crowns for mutual aſſiſtance to that end, and <q>at laſt it is concluded according to the opinion of <hi>Alva,</hi> which he ſaid was the judgement of King <hi>Philip,</hi> to cut off the chief heads of the Proteſtants and then in imitation of the<note n="*" place="margin">30. <hi>Mar.</hi> 1282 When the <hi>French</hi> were all at an inſtant without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of age or ſex cruelly ſlaughtered; as were the <hi>Danes</hi> here in <hi>England</hi> 280. years before that.</note>

<pb n="75" facs="tcp:31919:91"/> it ſeemed unſeaſonable, that buſineſs was deferred to another time, and was ſeven years after, as was then continued, put in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at</hi> Paris <hi>at a more convenient place and occaſion. But from this time the Prince of</hi> Conde <hi>and the Colinies being admoniſhed, by their friends at Court of theſe bloody Counſels, and thereupon ſuſpitious of the Court deſigns, were more cautious and wary.</hi> Yet was <hi>Colinius</hi> at the Aſſembly at <hi>Moulins</hi> in <hi>January</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>39.</hi>

They had ſeen and felt the Edicts made on their behalf, partly eluded by the interpretations of new Edicts and Proſcripts, partly violated by the malice and iniquity of Judges and Preſidents of the Provinces: injuries and miſchiefs every where done to them, and even the murthers of no ſmall number connived at, and permitted to go unpuniſhed. And beſides all this, they had
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:31919:92"/> certain intelligence of thoſe ſecret conſultations held for their deſtruction, and of other ſecret counſels held by Ambaſſadors with the Pope, who fomented the hatred of thoſe two Kings againſt them, and, beſides the ſpeeches and threats frequently given out that they were not like long to enjoy their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, they ſaw plainly that thoſe preparations, which (after the Cities which they inhabited were diſmantled, and Forts therein built, and Garriſons put into them) were at firſt made under ſuch pretext as was no way probable, and now conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued without any at all, were deſigned againſt them; and were alſo informed thereof by intelligence from their friends,<note place="margin">Sures, p. <hi>768.</hi>
                     </note> and by letters intercepted from <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi> Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding after a conſultation or two, it was reſolved by common conſent of all, to uſe all mild and gentle means; and therefore, ſince now there remained no further pretence to retain them, the Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> by his friends, deſires that, ſince <hi>Alva</hi> is now retired into <hi>Belgium,</hi> the <hi>Swiſſers</hi> may be diſmiſſed. But when inſtead of being diſmiſſed, or retained only to guard the Frontiers, they found them daily march on nearer to the heart of the Kingdom, and had further notice from the Court of their deſigns, they at laſt aſſemble in great confuſion; and though every one ſaw the danger which han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged over their heads, and was now ready to involve them all, yet great queſtion there was how it ſhould be prevented: To complain, they by experience knew what effect of that might be expected: to Arm, though in ſo great occaſion of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and extremity, they eaſily foreſaw many inconveniences attending that. [They only unhappily not foreſaw the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per remedy by their great Maſter preſcribed in ſuch caſe, to fly, though it had been to the greater humanity of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilized Indians: whereby they might perhaps better have conſulted their own ſafety, and alſo have promoted his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the propagation of his Truth and Goſpel.] But to Arm, beſides the miſchiefs of a Civil War, they thought that could not be without many calumnies and ſlanders caſt upon them by their adverſaries, as if they were the Authors of it, and undertook it againſt the King, to whom they did not ſo much as impute their former injuries and oppreſſions, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:31919:92"/> dangers, but only to their adverſaries, who having at firſt by force gotten the King into their power, abuſed his imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity and authority to ruine and deſtroy them: and although they ſhould take up Arms only againſt them, and meerly for the neceſſary defence of the lives and fortunes of themſelves, their wives, and children, and for the preſervation of the Kingdom, yet ſhould they not eſcape that imputation: and therefore they unanimouſly agreed <hi>rather being innocent, after the example of their anceſtors, to bear what injuries ſhould be done them, than to offer any to thoſe who were indeed nocent; leſt by an ill defence of a good cauſe they ſhould deſert that Equity or Juſtice which had hitherto ſtood on their part:</hi> till by the diſcourſe of <hi>Andelot,</hi> a perſon of great authority among the Peers, and beſides of known probity and virtue, they were perſwaded, that after ſo often breach of Faith by their adverſaries, there was no further truſt to be given to them; and for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies and ſlanders which ſhould be caſt upon them, the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of their ſo neceſſary undertakings, if it pleaſed God to bleſs them in ſo juſt a cauſe, would ſufficiently clear them.

Whereupon the young Prince falling diſtracted, and often attempting to kill himſelf, he was, at laſt, by <hi>Philip</hi> his Fathers own command, having firſt conſulted with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, poyſoned. Few months after, <hi>his Queen,</hi> whom he had employed in thoſe bloudy conſultations at the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view at <hi>Bayonne,</hi> died great with child, and not without ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of poiſon by his own means, being, as was thought, jealous and ſuſpitious of her too much familiarity with his own ſon, whom he had not long before thus murthered.

Moſt ſad and lamentable ſtories, ſays Davila, might be here related; for this cruelty was proſecuted in ſo many ſeveral places, with ſuch variety of accidents, againſt people of all conditions, as it was credibly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:31919:96"/> reported that there were ſlain above forty thouſand Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants in few days. The King himſelf, as<note place="margin">In vita Greg. <hi>13.</hi>

                     </note> not only by Cardinal Sancta Crux, four years before they were exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted at Paris, by him deſiring the Pope's confirmation, but alſo by letters under her own hand, as Capilupus teſtifies, who ſaith that he had ſeen the very letters themſelves. Nor was he only privy to theſe Counſels of the King and Queen-Mother, but likewiſe communicated his counſel and advice in the ſame buſineſs to them. <hi>He ſent to the King of France and his Miniſters moſt excellent inſtructions for the rooting out of thoſe Hereticks out of that Kingdom,</hi> ſays Cicarella,<note place="margin">Cicarel. in vita Pii, <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> but tells us not what they were, yet that is not hard to gueſs at from the conſideration of his nature and actions, (as hath been mentioned before) as well diſpoſed to promote cruel and bloudy deſigns as could be. And when thoſe Civil Wars, which for the ſpace of three years interrupted the courſe of thoſe Italian policies and ſtratagems, broke out, he ordered them alſo the aſſiſtance of his Forces. But when the War was concluded, and the King with his Mother and Cabinet-Council, had reſolved to make a Marriage between the young Prince of Navar, being now grown up, and the King's Siſter, to be the train to draw the Proteſtant party into that ſnare which had been ſo long before deviſed, the Pope not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this circumſtance, (for though the thing which was to be done had been long reſolved on, yet the method and manner how to bring it about, was often altered, as accidents and occaſions did intervene) when he heard of the treaty of the Marriage, but had not notice of the myſtery of it, and moreover heard of the preparations for a War againſt Spain, he began to be ſuſpitious that the King had forgotten his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer kindneſs and excellent inſtructions, and therefore ordered his Nephew Cardinal Alexandrino in his return from Spain, to debate the buſineſs with him. Whereupon the King aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured him that he did all this to obey the inſtructions of P. Pius. But P. Pius lived not to receive this ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">Catena in vita Pii, <hi>5.</hi>

But having received an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Maſſacre by letters from his Legate at Paris,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>53.</hi>
                     </note> he <hi>read his Letters in the Conſiſtory</hi> of Cardinals, where preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was decreed that they ſhould all go directly thence to St. Marks, and there ſolemnly give thanks to Almighty God for ſo great a bleſſing conferred upon the Roman See and the Chriſtian world;<note place="margin">In Minervae aede.</note> and that the Monday following <hi>a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Thanksgiving</hi> ſhould be celebrated in the Church of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva, and that the Pope and Cardinals ſhould be at it; and thereupon <hi>a Jubilee</hi> ſhould be <hi>publiſhed</hi> throughout all the whole Chriſtian World, and among other cauſes thereof ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, this was the firſt, To give thanks to God for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in France of the enemies of the Truth, and of the the Church. Toward the evening <hi>the Guns</hi> were <hi>fired</hi> at St. Angelo,<note place="margin">In Hadriani mole.</note> Bonefires every where made, and nothing omitted of thoſe things which uſed to be done upon the greateſt victories for the Church of Rome. Two daies after there was a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion to St. Lewis,</hi> with very great reſort of the Nobility and people; the Biſhops and Cardinals going before; then the Switzers; then the Embaſſadors of Kings and Princes; then under a Canopy the Pope himſelf, a Deacon Cardinal on either ſide him, and the Emperors Ambaſſador bearing up his train, and a troop of Knights and Gentlemen following. Being come to the Church, which was adorned with more than ordinary magnificence, Maſs was ſaid by the Cardinal of Lorain, (who for the incredible joy which he conceived for the ſo much deſired news, had ordered a thouſand<note place="margin">Aureos.</note> Franks to be given to the Meſſenger, who was a Gentleman ſent by his Brother the Duke of Aumale). Upon the Church-doors was ſet <hi>an Inſcription,</hi> in which the Cardinal of Lorain, in the name of the King of France, did congratulate the Pope and the Colledge of Cardinals the moſt wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and incredible iſſue of their Counſels and Aſſiſtances.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:31919:98"/> This done, <hi>Cardinal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rſin</hi> is appointed to go <hi>Legate</hi> into France, who ſpeedily took his journey,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>54.</hi>
                     </note> and being come as far as Lions, (where, next to Paris, was the moſt bloudy ſlaughter) he began to <hi>extol</hi> with many commendations, <hi>the Faith of the Citizens;</hi> and <hi>publickly praiſed Boidon,</hi> a moſt vile, wicked fellow, who afterward came to a death worthy of his wicked life, being executed at Clermont, but now was the ring-leader and principal promoter of the barbarous and horrid ſlaughters and murthers committed at Lions; and upon him he alſo,<note place="margin">Etiam ei pote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtatis plenitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine gratiae be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficium imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinit.</note> out of the plenitude of his (legatine) power conferred ſome of the Pope's favours and graces. And although by the King's Miniſters (who were now much otherwiſe affected with the ſenſe of the barbarous ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their Country-men; than was the Pope and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) he was admoniſhed to be very ſober and ſparing in his ſpeech of the Maſſacre, yet could he not hold, but every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, both in private conference and in publick, <hi>to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the King's prudence and magnanimity</hi> in that buſineſs: and ſo full was he of it, that being come to Paris, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to perſwade the King to the admiſſion of the Council of Trent in France, he urged it with this as a moſt weighty argument, <hi>That the memory of the late fact, which is to be commended to all ages, as conducing to the glory of God, and the dignity of the holy Roman Church, might be as it were ſealed by the approbation of the holy Synod. For ſo would it be manifeſt to all, who now are, or hereafter ſhall be, that the King conſented to the deſtruction of ſo many lives, not out of hatred or revenge, or ſenſe of any private injury of his own, but out of an ardent deſire to propagate the glory of God. That what could not be expected whilſt the faction of the Proteſtants ſtood, now they being taken away, the Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Religion, which by the Synod of Trent is cleared and defended from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome of the Sectaries, might be eſtabliſhed beyond controverſie, and without exception, through all the Provinces of the French Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> But the King had no mind to admit the Council, much leſs to make that an occaſion to perpetuate the memory of that fact which he was already contriving how to excuſe. And therefore was the Legate diſmiſſed without any effect as
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:31919:99"/> to that particular, to the Pope's no great ſatisfaction; yet he ſolaced himſelf with atchievement of the Maſſacre, which, becauſe it had happened in the beginning of his Papacy, he reckoned a moſt proſperous omen,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>52.</hi> Seres p. <hi>794.</hi>
                     </note> and among his greateſt fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licities. And to increaſe his comfort, the head of Colinius was ſent him to Rome for a preſent.</p>

                     </note>47. But alas, <hi>in France,</hi> all men generally, and the King himſelf had <hi>already far other thoughts of that Tragedy;</hi> and the Legate found a far other face of things there at his coming, than he expected, and had left at Rome: for the King now more ſenſible of the foulneſs and odiouſneſs of the fact, when done, (as is uſual in ſuch caſes, the heinouſneſs of ſin ſeldom appearing to wicked minds till actually com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted) was in great perplexity whether to own it or not, and how to excuſe it. And therefore it was long debated at Court, whether to admit the Legate at all, or by ſome hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome excuſes to put him off without audience, though out of reſpect to the Pope, and to the perſon of the Legate, thought well affected to the intereſt of France, it was at laſt permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but not without ſuch caution and admonition to him as hath been mentioned. For this unhappy King had no ſooner accompliſhed theſe deep deſigns, from which he promiſed himſelf ſo great ſecurity, content and happineſs, but he found himſelf ſurprized and involved in inextricable difficulties, perplexity and miſery. And beſides the daily ſecret <hi>horrors of his mind and conſcience,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>57.</hi>
                     </note> which appeared in their nocturnal effects and productions, diſturbing and interrupting his ſleep with <hi>direful and frightful dreams,</hi> which drove him to the uſe of Saul's remedy, by Muſick to refreſh and quiet his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed ſpirits,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.</note> that anxiety which aroſe in his mind after the fact committed, from his <hi>fears and doubts of what might be the ill conſequence</hi> of it, was now no leſs than his hopes had been before of that happineſs and tranquility which he had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed himſelf that he ſhould obtain by it. For though he had before promiſed himſelf great ſecurity by the deſtruction of the heads, and ſlaughter of ſo great a party of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, yet having done the deed, that <hi>deſperation into which he apprehended his perfidious cruelty had driven thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:31919:99"/> and by the articles of the laſt agreement of Peace held Rochel and other ſtrong places in their poſſeſſion, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them not a little formidable to him, and perplexed his mind with doubts and fears of new troubles from ſo juſt and great provocation. Theſe <hi>cares</hi> of what might be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this action at home,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>53.</hi>
                     </note> were increaſed and aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by his apprehenſion <hi>of what effects ſo barbarous an act</hi> (which is reported to have filled with ſtupor and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Great Turk himſelf at the hearing of it) <hi>might produce in his neighbours abroad,</hi> leſt they thereby might be moved out of commiſeration to ſend their aid and relief to his ſo injuriouſly oppreſſed ſubjects. Wherefore <hi>all ways and means</hi> were <hi>ſtudied and deviſed to give ſome ſatisfaction</hi> to the Proteſtants at home by treaties and favourable Edicts, (though his former often and foul breaches of his Faith made this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry difficult) and to excuſe the foulneſs of the late fact both to them and to the Princes and States abroad.<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>52.</hi>
                     </note> It had been conſidered before-hand out of that ſenſe and pre-apprehenſion they had of the wickedneſs and foulneſs of the deſign, how to caſt the imputation of it upon the Guiſes, who alſo out of the ſame ſenſe and pre-apprehenſion endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured all they could to avoid the odium of it. And being done, the King immediately, whether affrighted and terrified, ſays Thuanus, with the atrocity of the fact, or fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the odium of it, diſpatched his <hi>Letters</hi> to the Preſidents of the Provinces, <hi>to lay all the blame upon the Guiſes,</hi> alledging that it was done without his privity or conſent; that they, fearing that the friends and relations of Colinius would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injury done to him upon them, had raiſed the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, which he was not able to repreſs in time; with a great deal to this purpoſe. And to the ſame purpoſe were Letters written by the Queen, and ſent not only through France, but alſo to the Helvetians, and diſperſed through England, and in divers parts of Germany. But as it uſually happens upon the perpetration of ſuch horrid crimes and wickedneſs, that the authors of them diſtracted with the horrors of their guilty conſcience, when they find no ſatisfaction or aſſurance of ſecurity in any courſe they take to conceal or palliate their crime, continually deviſe and attempt new ways and means,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:31919:100"/> and by their often change and inconſtancy to any, promote that diſcovery which they ſeek to evade; ſo it happened in this caſe. For as theſe Letters were diſproved by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs commands, which, as <hi>Davila</hi> relates, he had but few daies before ſent out; ſo doth he now again in few days after contract the ſame, and in full Senate <hi>declares that all was done by his own will and command,</hi> and orders ſo much to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of record in the publick acts of the Court.<note place="margin">Cicarel. in vita Greg. <hi>13.</hi> Thu. l. <hi>53.</hi>
                     </note> And though to the Pope and Spaniard he owned that he did it upon the ſcore of Religion, yet knowing that with others, this would not ſo much excuſe as aggravate and increaſe the odium of it, ſome other cauſe was to be deviſed and pretended. And therefore firſt to extenuate the fact,<note place="margin">V. l. <hi>54.</hi>
                     </note> he pretends that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands extended only to the cutting off of Colinius and his Confederates, which thing being once undertaken, the tumult at Paris proceeded further than he intended, or was able, ſo ſoon as he deſired, to reſtrain; and that other Cities taking example from thence, did the like without his licenſe, and to his great grief and trouble: and then for the cauſe <hi>pretends a Conſpiracy</hi> againſt himſelf, his Mother and Brothers, and Navar himſelf, and to make Conde King, and afterwards to kill him alſo, and ſet up Colinius. And though the cauſes pretended againſt Colinius, in the judgment of the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent men, who were not at all addicted to the Proteſtant party, ſays Thuanus, had not ſo much colour of truth as will perſwade even children to believe them, much leſs any ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof; yet to put ſome colour upon the buſineſs, <hi>a Trial</hi> was <hi>ordered</hi> to be had in form of Law; and two days after <hi>a Jubilee</hi> (as hath been ſaid) was <hi>appointed,</hi> and <hi>an Edict pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,</hi> wherein the King declares, that what had happened was done by his expreſs command, but not out of hatred to the (Proteſtant) Religion, or to derogate from the Edicts of Pacification, which he ſtill deſired ſhould be inviolably and religiouſly obſerved; but to prevent the Conſpiracy of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linius and his Confederates, &amp;c. and <hi>Letters to</hi> like purpoſe were ſent <hi>to the Preſidents</hi> of the Provinces, declaring, as was pretended, the TRUE cauſes of the tumult, and comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them to treat the Proteſtants in all friendly manner,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>53.</hi>
                     </note> &amp;c. And that nothing might be wanting, ſays Thuanus, to the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:31919:100"/> height of madneſs, that they might ſeem to glory and triumph in ſo deteſtable an enterpriſe, in emulation of the ancient Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, <hi>Medals</hi> were <hi>coyned</hi> with the Inſcriptions, VIRTUS IN REBELLEIS &amp; PIETAS EXCITAVIT JUSTITI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>AM. Divers other ſuch like arts were uſed to put a face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the buſineſs, and make it look like a happy prevention of ſome terrible Conſpiracy. But what was the moſt deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all, by the accumulating of ſin upon ſin, as is uſual in ſuch caſes, was the <hi>groſs abuſe of Juſtice it ſelf,</hi> whereby the Courts of Juſtice were drawn into the participation of the guilt, by an <hi>horrible and abominable Sentence,</hi> not only <hi>againſt Colinius</hi> who was dead, but his children who were alive; and alſo againſt <hi>Monſieur de Briquemaut,</hi> who had fled to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ambaſſadors; <hi>and Arnald Cavagnes</hi> Maſter of Requeſts, who had hid himſelf hard-by with a friend, who admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him of the danger, but were both taken and impriſoned in the Palace, and the ſame day that Sentence was given againſt Colinius, were <hi>condemned to death,</hi> which Cavagnes ſuffered with admirable conſtancy, reciting Prayers out of the Pſalms by heart, in Latin, for three hours together, with his eyes ſteadily fixed towards Heaven: but his companion at firſt, affrighted with his approaching death, made an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy offer for the redemption of his life, to diſcover a means how to ſurprize Rochel; yet afterwards, when the King refuſed that condition, but offered him another, which was, that he ſhould acknowledg himſelf guilty of the crimes objected to him, and confeſs before the people that there was a Conſpiracy entred into by Colinius againſt the King, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed that, and choſe rather to ſuffer death, which accordingly he did with Cavagnes. While theſe &amp; ſuch like arts were uſed to excuſe and diſguiſe the buſineſs at home; to do it abroad, beſides the Queens Letters above-mentioned, were ſeveral <hi>Ambaſſadors employed</hi> in Helvetia, Germany, England, Poland, and other foreign Countries, where they either reſided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or were ſent on purpoſe for this ſervice, and <hi>Learned men ſuborned</hi> and perſwaded to do it by printed Books. But all theſe, not having any certain ground of truth, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon foundation for all to build upon, while each alledged, not what he did know or believe to be true, but what his own
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:31919:101"/> genius dictated as moſt plauſible and likely to put ſome colour upon the buſineſs: ſome extenuating the fact as to the King's acting in it; and others on the contrary juſtifying the ſame; ſome excuſing it only by way of recrimination for things done in the late Wars; and others inſiſting upon the pretended conſpiracy of Colinius; were not only confuted by others, who alſo in print anſwered their writings and ſpeeches, but of themſelves betrayed and detected the vanity of their ſeveral pretences and allegations, by their inconſiſtency and diſagreement one with another. The Learned Lawyer Fr. Baldwin was hereunto ſollicited, but was more ingenuous than to be retained in the patronage of ſo foul a cauſe: and yet among thoſe who undertook this office, beſides the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries, were ſome perſons otherwiſe of honour and repute, who, becauſe what was done could not be undone, partly to conſult the credit of their King and Countrey, partly to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the preſent ſtate of affairs, endeavoured either by feigned praiſes, or officious excuſes, to cover and palliate that fact which in their hearts they detected. And ſome were therein ſo far tranſported, and over-ſhot themſelves, out of zeal for the honour and good of their Countrey, that our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous author deplores their actings in it, eſpecially as to that foul buſineſs of the Trial and Sentence above-mentioned. But generally the French Courtiers, who were more ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than to proſtitute their reputation by aſſerting that piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pretence of the conſpiracy, yet uſed all their art to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the caſe, as a ſudden accidental thing, and not ſo long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore contrived as the Italians and Spaniards relate.</p>
                  <p n="48">48. It is very uſual and even natural to men, eſpecially to the more conſidering minds, when any thing rare and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary doth occur, not to reſt ſatisfied with the bare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of the thing, but alſo to reflect back, and enquire into <hi>the cauſes of it.</hi> And therefore ſince Thuanus relates that <hi>the more prudent of thoſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lib.</hi> 53.</note> who, being no way addicted to the Proteſtant party, with good and honeſt meaning ſought how to excuſe this execrable fact, yet in their heart deteſting the ſame, did alſo ſeriouſly conſider the cauſes of it, <hi>their ſenſe and judgment</hi> in that reſpect may likewiſe deſerve our obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:31919:101"/> They ſaw apparently that ſo infamous and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious counſels could not proceed but from minds ſo ſtrangely infatuated and blinded, and did ſeem to argue a ſpecial judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God upon them. And of that, the cauſes to which it might be reaſonably attributed were very obvious and eaſy to be diſcovered. For ſuch was the profaneneſs, debauchery and wickedneſs; which prevailing in the King, (through his evil Education by his Mother and thoſe Tutors to whom ſhe committed him) and in the Court, were by the evil example thereof derived to the City, and thence to the Countrey-Towns and Villages, and ſo diffuſed through the whole Kingdom, as could not but provoke the Holy Majeſty of God to ſend down his judgments upon them. This is the ſum of their judgment, only he<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gives more particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the ſins of common Swearing, Adultery and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, to which others add many more, and tell us in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that then never was there any more vicious or more corrupted Court. And indeed, thoſe were ſuch cauſes, as, being ſo obvious and notorious, no ſerious Chriſtian believing, and inſtructed in the Sacred Scriptures, but would readily aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the caſe.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.</note> For thus doth St. Paul inform the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, of ſuch as hold the truth in unrighteouſneſs, (and our Romaniſts might do well to be admoniſhed by it) that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, their fooliſh heart was darkened, and he gave them up to the luſts of their own hearts, to vile affections, and to a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate mind, to do thoſe things which are not convenient, being filled with all Injuſtice, Fornication, Murder, Deceit, breach of Faith, &amp;c. What-ever be the profeſſion which ſuch men make of Religion, moſt certain it is, that there is either great error and corruption in their Religion, or little ſincerity and life in their profeſſion, or laſtly, ſuch impotence in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, that the prevalence of their ſenſual affections doth eaſily over-power and faſcinate their reaſon; which argues their deſertion by that Sacred Spirit which infuſes light and life, and heat and power into humane ſouls, as they are diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to receive it, no leſs than doth the Sun communicate its kind influences to the corporal and animal nature. And as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:31919:102"/> this doth maturate and ſweeten crude and ſour fruits, and confirm and ſtrengthen the tender plants; ſo doth that, where it is indeed heartily embraced, admirably diſpoſe mens minds to ſweetneſs and tranquility in themſelves, to ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and devotion to God, to ſweetneſs, kindneſs and benignity to men; and makes theſe diſpoſitions ſtrong and powerful in them. Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is power: it informs the mind and underſtanding, it reforms the will and affections, and transforms the whole man into its own like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Theſe are the fruits of the Spirit by which we are to judge of the tree. This is that whereby all true Chriſtians have a real and internal, not meerly external or political, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and union with their Head Chriſt Jeſus, and through him with the fountain, from whom, by him, it is derived to all his true members; (of his fulneſs we all receive), and one with another, they are all partakers of the ſame Spirit, (a nearer alliance than that of bloud) and are filled with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der affection to all the children of the ſame Father, and love to all the creatures of their great Lord, and for his ſake even to their enemies, to thoſe that perſecute and injure them; pitying their blindneſs and madneſs, and deſiring their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, not deſtruction. But no ſooner or further is any man deſerted by this bleſſed Spirit, or devoid of his ſweet influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but he preſently becomes ſo much the more obnoxious to all the malevolent aſpects of wicked ſpirits, and is impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and filled with the poiſon of their infections, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites and exalgitates to exorbitancy his ſenſual affections, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentates his underſtanding, and continually foments and promotes the aſſimulation and likeneſs of their own nature in him, cheriſhing and fructifying the roots which are in him, of Pride, Ambition, Envy, Malice, Revenge, Perfidiouſneſs, and all manner of luſts and wickedneſs, according to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſpoſition. And becauſe there is ſo ſtrong and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful a propenſity to Religion rooted and fixed in the very nature of man, as is very difficult, if not impoſſible utterly to extirpate or depreſs this in ſuch a perſon, is by the ſubtil operation of theſe agents, either, if more languid and remiſs,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:31919:102"/> diverted, by exciting him to an eager proſecution of his other more ſtrong inclinations; or, if more intenſe and active, perverted either into ſuperſtition, or ſome other conceived heroick acts of a partial Religion, conſiſting and concurring with the ſatisfaction of his other inclinations: whence or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily proceeds much of that heat and zeal which we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſee in men for their ſeveral parties, for the ſhells and out-ſides of Religion; for opinions and notions, no more neceſſary to be known and determined to make men compleat Chriſtians, than the ſpeculations of Philoſophers; and often for pernitious and deſtructive principles, eſpecially in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts; and inconſiderate endeavours, by fraud and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, ſedition or oppreſſion, and violent perſecutions, and ſuch like moſt unchriſtian actions, for the advancement of the cauſe which they eſpouſe; whereby they encourage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with ſecret hopes to expiate their licentiouſneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to their own inclinations in other matters, and eaſily perſwade themſelves that ſo long as they are ſuch good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, or well affected to the truth and the cauſe of God and his Church, that all muſt needs be well with them. And hence proceeded this not only unchriſtian, but barbarous and inhumane, perfidious, bloudy action of Charles 9. Hence the ſuſpition of his Brother and Succeſſors Henr. 3. Hence all the licentiouſneſs and wickedneſs which we ſee every where in the World. And to all this is no ſmall occaſion given by the complying Conduct, Commutations of Penances, and other practices of the Jeſuites and other Romaniſts. But the ſame Apoſtle informs us of <hi>another cauſe</hi> near of kin to this, and no leſs effectual to the provocation of this judgment of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duration of mens minds, which is very likely to have had no little influence in this caſe: and that is the reſiſting, reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, or not receiving and embracing of the Truth when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: which he mentions in a paſſage, which, if I be not much miſtaken, concerns the defection of the Church of Rome, and hath been ſo underſtood by the Chriſtians in all ages, (though ſomewhat obſcurely and imperfectly, as is uſual in the interpretations of prophetick writings before they be fulfilled); as well agrees with the conjecture. Becauſe they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:31919:103"/> receive not the love of the Truth, ſaith he, For this cauſe God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.</note> And this 'tis very likely had no ſmall influence in this caſe. For if out of the Roman Religion we take all that which the Proteſtants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and profeſs, which the Romaniſts muſt needs confeſs to be truly Catholick, the greateſt part of the reſt hath been either introduced, or ſo new modelled and accommodated to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular intereſt and advantage of the See of Rome within this 600 years laſt paſt, as hath not only given occaſion to moſt of the troubles and miſchiefs in Europe ever ſince, but very much injured, diſhonoured and prejudiced Chriſtianity it ſelf. And when it pleaſed God by his providence, both long ſince, and again of latter days, to raiſe up a people in the Confines of France, who retaining that which of all ſides is confeſſed to be truly Catholick, rejected thoſe novel corruptions and abuſes, (though perhaps with them ſome things which might be tolerated), and thereby gave ſo fair occaſion to the French upon further conſideration, and with more mature deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to reform the ſame, (as Queen Eliz. did here), that a great part of the moſt ſober and pious of the French Nation, even Biſhops and Cardinals, being thereupon ſenſible of the need of it, did earneſtly deſire and ſollicit the convention of a National Synod to that purpoſe; the French Kings were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily ſo far wrought upon by the arts of Rome, as not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ungratefully to reject that benefit offered by the Divine Providence, but at laſt to perſecute thoſe who were made the occaſions of it. And this ſeems to have been ſo manifeſt a cauſe of the troubles, miſchiefs and adverſities, which by the providence of God have befallen that Nation and their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſince the beginning of that Century,<note place="margin">1500.</note> that it is ſtrange (but that the height of contentions then on foot might perhaps hinder it) that neither thoſe prudent conſidering men did take notice of it in this caſe, nor yet our judicious and candid Author, who relates their judgment, and had himſelf obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved almoſt as much in Lewis 12. <hi>If it be fit,</hi> ſays he, <hi>for a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man to ſpeak his opinion concerning the eternal Counſels of God,</hi>

                     <hi>I ſhould ſay that there was no other cauſe why that moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Prince, in ſo many reſpects commendable and worthy of a

(undoubtedly ſo ordered for the ſame purpoſe by the Divine Providence) firſt at Lions, and then at Piſa for the reformation of the Church, and his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals coined with this Inſcription, PERDAM BABYLONIS NOMEN, and how after all this he renounced the Council at Piſa through the importunities of his wife, and ſubſcribed to the Lateran Council to gratifie the next Pope Leo 10. and adding that <hi>in the judgment of many he had done more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedly if he had perſevered in his purpoſe of reforming the Church,</hi> he concludes; <hi>Theſe therefore were the cauſes both of the declination of our Empire, and of the adverſe fortune of Lewis:</hi> who after all his other misfortunes died without iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue male, which he much deſired to ſucceed him. And in this King is very obſervable, that as there was in him no want of magnanimity, humane prudence, or care for himſelf, the glory of his Kingdom, and proſperity of his affairs, to which his misfortunes could be imputed, which makes the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God therein the more apparent; ſo neither could any vice or other fault be noted in him, which might be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as a cauſe of that judgment, but what is here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, the neglect of that duty whereunto he was ſo fairly led, and whereof he was ſo far convinced, as that he began to put it in execution. In the time of his ſucceſſor Francis 1. all things ſeemed to conſpire in giving occaſion every where to the Reformation of the Church, what through the Pope's differences with ſeveral Princes, which produced the abolition and abrogation of the Papal Authority for ſome time in Spain, and afterward in England; what through that abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable impoſture of Indulgences and other their groſs wickedneſs and abuſes, which provoked Martin Luther and other learned men to ſearch into, and detect their myſtery of iniquity, and diſcover many groſs errors and abuſes crept into
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:31919:104"/> the Church, whereupon enſued the Reformation happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun and promoted by many Proteſtant Princes and Cities in Germany, and other parts. But Francis not only neglected the occaſion, and rejected and made himſelf unworthy of the common benefit of it, but moreover contracted that<note n="*" place="margin">He married his Son Henr. <hi>2.</hi> to Katharine of Medices daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Lawrence D. of Urbin, who was Nephew to Leo <hi>10.</hi> and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin to Clem. <hi>7.</hi>

[Nor was the King of Spain much more happy in his perſecutions of the Proteſtants in the Low-Countries, the conſequence whereof was the loſs of the beſt part of them: and all he got by the Inquiſition in Spain, was but the excluſion of light and truth from his people, and his own ſlavery to the ſtrong deluſions and infatuations of the Jeſuites, who preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated him into divers diſhonourable, unſuccesful, and to his own affairs pernitious undertakings.]</p>
                  <p n="49">49. But to return to the effects and conſequences of that bloudy act, whereof what hath yet been related, was but the firſt fruits of thoſe Counſels from which ſo much happineſs, tranquility and glory were ſo long expected, inſtead whereof was reaped only horror, ſhame and anxiety, whereunto ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded a plentiful harveſt of other real troubles. For the King and that Faction which prevailed at Court, after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny former breaches of publick Faith, by this ſo inhumane cruelty and foul breach of Faith, ſo much the greater, by how much the greater arts and deep diſſimulation had been uſed before to raiſe a truſt &amp; confidence of their ſincerity, had now driven thoſe of the Proteſtants who remained alive to that diſtruſt and jealouſie (the uſual fruits of perfidiouſneſs) of what-ever Letters, Promiſes, Edicts, or other means could be deviſed to ſatisfy them, that nothing could give them any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance of their lives and ſafety, but retaining thoſe places which by the laſt agreement of Peace were left in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for their ſecurity, (and were now, had the agreement been performed,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>53.</hi>
                     </note> to have been delivered) to ſtand upon their defence. And though many of them not only doubting of their ſtrength, but making ſcruple of the juſtice of the cauſe, now ſince not only the Princes of the blood, to whom the adminiſtration of the Kingdom did belong, were abſent, but
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:31919:104"/> moreover the King himſelf was grown a man, did diſpute againſt it, and from both thoſe grounds urged all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they could: yet againſt the firſt of theſe, the horror of theſe ſlaughters, which they had ſo lately ſeen, and did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, prevailed, and deſpair made the moſt timerous couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And this alſo made the anſwer which was returned by others to the latter, more ſatisfactory to the reſt; that to take up Arms for their juſt defence, not to offer violence to any, but only to repel the injury, and ſave themſelves from ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was neither by the Laws of God or man unlawful; that it ought not to be reputed a war againſt the King, but a juſt defence againſt their enemies who abuſed the King's autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to deſtroy them, who if ſo powerful as to have proceeded ſo far in the late tumult beyond his conſent or privity, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with him as to work his aſſent to ſo unjuſt and foul an action, they had the more reaſon to ſecure themſelves againſt their power and treachery, till juſtice ſhould be done upon them; nor ought they to doubt, but in ſo juſt a cauſe upon their ſerious repentance, truſt in God, and humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to him, he would graciouſly pity their miſery, and provide ſome unexpected means for their relief. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing La Charite was ſurprized at the time of the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre, and the ſame was attempted againſt Montabon,<note place="margin">Da. p. <hi>377.</hi>

And at laſt when arts failed, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally after the maſſacre at Burdeaux, in the midſt of their trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the King's Forces were ſent to aſſault them. <hi>And theſe</hi> (ſays Thuanus, after a more particular relation of them) <hi>were the beginnings of the Fourth Civil War in France, the more memorable, becauſe from ſo ſmall beginnings, beyond the hope and expectation even of thoſe who</hi> through neceſſity <hi>rather than upon counſel and deſign did manage it, when, ſo many Commanders being ſlain, the Nobility who remained diſperſed abroad, and the people in all places aſtoniſhed, all was thought ſubdued, within
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:31919:105"/> the compaſs of a year, without the foreign aid of any Prince, and money every where after ſo great plunders failing</hi> them, <hi>it reſtored the affairs of the Proteſtants</hi> to good condition again. And yet this was only a defenſive War on their part, and, as he ſays, of neceſſity, wherein thoſe poor people fought only for their lives and ſafety, and not to neglect the King's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, were willing to keep their meetings at Sermons only ſecretly in the night, and not openly in the day-time, which yet could not be denied them without manifeſt injuſtice and breach of publick Faith. But ſuch were their apprehenſions of the perfidiouſneſs and cruelty of their enemies, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions thereupon, that they choſe rather to ſuffer all the miſeries and neceſſities that humane nature is able to bear, than again to truſt to the mercy or promiſes of them whom they had ſo often found perfidious, and moreover at laſt ſo barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly inhumane and cruel.

<pb n="104" facs="tcp:31919:106"/> ſhe forced again to provide for their ſecurity, and ſtand upon their defence, by a perfidious attempt to ſurprize Rochel by her emiſſaries, who had corrupted ſome in the City to betray it to the Forces, which for that purpoſe they had drawn near it; but alſo againſt a conſiderable <hi>party of the Catholicks,</hi> (as they call them) whom, while ſhe thought it neceſſary for the continuance of her power and authority in the government, to keep up, and foment factions among the chief Nobility; ſhe, by over-doing what ſhe deſigned, forced, for their own ſafety and ſecurity, to joyn their complaints and forces with the Proteſtants. Whereby (conſidering the diviſion of that party) ſhe in ſome ſort repaired the loſs which the Proteſtant party had ſuſtained by the maſſacres; the Providence of God undoubtedly thus ordering it to manifeſt the vanity of their former hopes of peace and tranquility by ſuch wicked cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for the deſtruction of the Proteſtants, and to puniſh by their mutual diſſentions among themſelves, their former una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity in perſecuting them. The <hi>chief of this party</hi> were the ſons of the old Conſtable Momorancy, (in his time an active perſecutor of the Proteſtants) the Viſcount de Turenne, and others, whom the Queen, favouring the contrary faction of the Guiſes, continually by divers calumnies incenſing and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperating the King againſt them, and by other ſtratagems which they diſcovered, drove into deſpair of ſafety by any other means; which no doubt was not a little increaſed by the experience which they had ſeen of her perfidiouſneſs and cruelty in the caſe of the Proteſtants, all men being ſuſpitious of thoſe whom they have obſerved falſe and perfidious to others.

Davila ſaith he began ſome months before to ſpit bloud; others that he died of a Bloudy-flux, and that much bloud iſſued out of all the paſſages of his body; and that he happened to fall down, and wallowed in his own bloud. And whereas Davila ſays that he ended his life with grave and pious diſcourſes, others ſay that he ended it with imprecations and curſings, and that his laſt words were meer blaſphemies. Whereof, which is moſt credible, the reader conſidering his natural tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, life and actions, may eaſily judge. He died under five and twenty years of age, without iſſue male to ſucceed him, leaving only a daughter by his Queen, with whom he had been above four years married, and a baſtard-ſon. And theſe were the fruits which he reaped of his bloudy and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious counſels and practices.</p>

Yet he was no ſooner arrived in France, but by the counſel of his Mother and the Guiſian and Italian faction, (the ſame Cabal which contrived the maſſacre) he reſolved the contrary, till finding it a work too hard by open force to deſtroy the remaining part of the Proteſtants, being more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over ſtrengthened by the aſſociation of the Politicks with them, there was at laſt <hi>a Peace concluded</hi> upon ſuch terms, as,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>62.</hi> Davila. l. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> had they been granted in ſincerity, and juſtly performed, might have produced much happineſs to that Kingdom. For, beſides what related to the particular concerns of Alancon, D'Anvil, and others of the Politicks and male-contents, to the Proteſtants was granted full liberty of Conſcience, and free exerciſe of their Religion, without exception of times or places, &amp;c. and Towns for their ſecurity till the Articles ſhould be fully and perfectly performed. And theſe Articles were concluded by the Queen-Mother her ſelf in perſon, and <hi>confirmed</hi> by a publick Edict with all the ſolemnity that could be, the King himſelf being preſent in Parliament, ſitting in his Throne of Juſtice. <q>But theſe Articles, ſays Davila, as ſoon as they were known to thoſe of the Catholick party, exaſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated moſt of their minds in ſuch manner, that they not only murmured freely againſt the King himſelf and the Queen-Mother, but many were diſpoſed to riſe, and would have taken Arms to diſturb the unjuſtneſs [as they call it] of that Peace, which was generally [by them] eſteemed ſhameful, and not fit to be kept, if within a-while they had not manifeſtly underſtood, that the King and Queen, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to recover and draw home the Duke of Alancon, had conſented to conditions in words, which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved not to obſerve in deeds. For, (as he preſently adds) having exactly performed all things promiſed to the Duke of Alancon, <hi>none of the other Articles</hi> were <hi>obſerved</hi> either to the Proteſtants in general, or to the King of Navar and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:31919:108"/> Prince of Conde in particular: but the King permitting, and tacitly conſenting to it, the Aſſemblies of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants were every where violently diſturbed, &amp;c. And <hi>the Guiſes,</hi> who were not ſlack in laying hold of any opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to augment their own greatneſs, and to ſecure the ſtate of that Religion, which was ſo ſtreightly linked to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, began upon the conjuncture of ſo great an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſecretly to <hi>make a league of the Catholicks,</hi> in all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of the Kingdom, under colour of oppoſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and eſtabliſhment of hereſy, which by the Articles of the Peace was ſo fully authorized and eſtabliſhed.</q> And this was the Faith of a Catholick Prince, whoſe Conſcience was directed by the religious Jeſuites, and ſo great a votary, that though a King, he would often make one of the Flagellantes, and was believed would have changed his Kingdom for a Cell,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>61:</hi> Busbeq. epiſt. <hi>20.</hi>
                     </note> though Guiſe had never attempted to force him to it: this the obedience and loyalty of his Catholick Subjects.

                     </note> became ſenſible of their deſigns, and of his own danger, which more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appeared in certain ſecret <hi>inſtructions to Nic.

The King therefore returns them a wary anſwer, ſuch as though not altogether denying their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, yet gave them no great ſatisfaction.

Whereupon in the firſt encounter (the Turk lifting up his eyes to Heaven, and calling to Chriſt to behold and puniſh the perfidious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where-with his followers had diſhonoured him) he was himſelf ſlain with 30000 of his men: on the other ſide <hi>the French Theologiſts</hi> did openly both in Sermons and printed Books <hi>contend that the Prince is not obliged to keep Faith with the Hereticks,</hi> alledging to that purpoſe the Decree of the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:31919:109"/> Council of Conſtance, and therefore War is to be undertaken to extirpate them. And by the advice of the Biſhop of Lymoges and Morvillier (ſometime Biſhop of Orleans) <hi>the King</hi> determined, ſince he could not by open reſiſtance hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the deſigns and progreſs of the League, (which already had taken too deep root) to <hi>make himſelf Head</hi> and Protector of it, and draw that authority to himſelf, which he ſaw they endeavoured to ſettle upon the Head <hi>of the League,</hi> both with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in and without the Kingdom; which accordingly he did, cauſing it to be read, publiſhed, and ſworn in open aſſembly, and with high proteſtations declared that he would ſpend his laſt breath to reduce all his people to a unity in Religion, and an entire obedience to the Roman Church: which done, he without much difficulty prevailed with Navar and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to yield to ſome reſtraints of the publick exerciſe of their Religion.

Which in part proceeded, and perhaps had been accompliſhed, if the King had not time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recalled thoſe he had employed: whereupon he was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to depart from Paris, which he did; but not long after returning thither, he is preſented with a Petition, which at a <hi>Conſultation at Nancy</hi> (where it was concluded that Guiſe and the other confederate Lord,<note place="margin">Da. p. <hi>668.</hi> Thu. l. <hi>90.</hi>

And though the King did not ſo much refuſe, as by excuſes delay to anſwer it, the Preachers labour to caſt all the odium they can upon him, inveigh againſt him as favouring the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and on the other ſide highly extol and magnify the Catholick Princes, ſo they called the Guiſians. And Guiſe his coming to the City is by frequent Letters much impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuned; which though, according to the former concluſion, he at preſent deferred, yet were ſome experienced Souldiers ſent to them, he not being willing to truſt to the City Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders

And now reckoning their ſtrength 20000 men, there is <hi>a new Conſpiracy</hi> to fall upon the Louvre, and killing the guard, and all about him whom they ſuſpect, to ſeize upon the King.

And this being alſo diſcovered, the King conſults how to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure himſelf againſt the Conſpirators. In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> unexpectedly <hi>comes to Paris</hi> contrary to the King's command. And while the King ſeeks to ſtrengthen himſelf, and preventing the Leaguers to ſecure the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant places of the City, the Pariſians are raiſed at the ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Bells, make Barricadoes croſs the ſtreets, come up to the Louvre, and begin to aſſault it. Whereupon the Queen-Mother goes to Guiſe in her Sedan, being denied paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in her Coach, and confers with him, but brings back no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but complaints, and exorbitant demands. But the ſiege preſſing much on the one ſide, when it was feared they would likewiſe beſiege it on the other, the Queen-mother go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again to Guiſe, and having notice by the way that 15000 men were preparing to encloſe the Louvre on the other ſide, holds him in a long treaty, while <hi>the King</hi> with 26 Gentlemen <hi>ſteals ſecretly away to Chartres,</hi> to the no ſmall grief of Guiſe and the Leaguers who had loſt ſo fair an opportunity. Whereupon they ſecure and ſtrengthen Paris, lay ſiege to the Boys de Vincernes, which yielded without reſiſtance, as did alſo St. Cloud, Lagny, Charranton, with all the other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Towns. <hi>The King</hi> being again reduced to his former ſtraits of accepting the aſſiſtance of the Proteſtants, or yielding to ſuch terms as the Leaguers would pleaſe to give him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long conſultation at length <hi>reſolved to uſe the ſame means againſt Guiſe, which he</hi> remembred <hi>had been uſed</hi> in the reign of

Wherein he commends their piety and zeal in promoting the buſineſs of Religion, comparing Guiſe to the Holy Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees, the defenders of the people of Iſrael, ſo highly extolled in the Sacred Scriptures, and exhorting him to continue ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesfully and gloriouſly to fight for the advancement of the Church, and the total extirpation of the Proteſtants, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints him with his own unceſſant prayers for the Divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to him, adding that nothing could be more ſeaſonable for the preſent occaſion, than that he ſhould have his Legate in France, by whoſe means and authority their endeavours might be promoted for the good of the Kingdom, and of the Catholick Religion.

<pb n="116" facs="tcp:31919:112"/> the Eccleſiaſticks, the Arch-Biſhop of Ambrun, with twelve of each Order, repair to the King, and deſire that by his authority, and a publick Edict, the Decree may be confirmed. But the King utterly averſe from it, though he would not plainly deny it, yet put it off as well as he could; but ſuch was the obſtinacy of the States, that he was forced at laſt to anſwer that he agreed to the general vote, and would think of cauſing the Decree to be framed. Guiſe alſo with all his might urged the receiving of <hi>the Council of Trent,</hi> whereunto, though the King conſented, yet was it <hi>rejected</hi> with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, not only by the Nobility, but by a great many of the Clergy. This was urged by him partly as a powerful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine againſt the Proteſtants, partly further to oblige the Pope, if it ſucceeded, and to raiſe a prejudice in him againſt the King, if it ſucceeded not by his default. And to ingratiate himſelf the more with the people, he moves for eaſe of grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances by impoſitions and taxes, though a thing inconſiſtent with the proſecution of the War againſt the hereticks. But the King finding now a convenient opportunity to execute his deſign, acquaints ſome of his confidents with it, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ordered all things ſo as to avoid the ſuſpition of Guiſe, much after the manner heretofore uſed againſt Colinius, he commands him to be ſlain, which was accordingly<note n="*" place="margin">The manner of his death, ſee in the notes upon the hiſtory of the Maſſacre.

Thus do thoſe who had wickedly conſpired the barbarous ſlaughter of ſo many innocent Proteſtants, now, by the juſt judgment and vengeance of God upon them, mutually conſpire one anothers deſtruction.

In the mean time to heighten and inflame the odium of the people againſt the King, nothing is omitted either in the Pulpit, or out of it, by ſlanders, calumnies, and falſe reports. And while among other deviſes they endeavour to repreſent him as a worſhipper of Satyrs, and a Magitian, they exerciſe a kind of magick or witchcraft againſt him, deviſing religious execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and inſtituting ſtrange ſuperſtitious rites, women and maids clad only in ſuch fine linen that their bodies might be ſeen through it, and ſome carrying burning tapers in their hands, they ſang over certain myſterious rithms with diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and confuſed tones and voices, and then ſuddenly extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed their torches, as if they hoped or wiſhed that the King's life ſhould be thereby, or in like manner alſo extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed; and a great deal ſuch ſtuff too long to be here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. By theſe means were the people every where incenſed and enraged againſt the King; but eſpecially by the new Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of the Preachers and Confeſſors were the minds of men generally ſo perverted, that they made it almoſt a ſport to break Faith with him, and betray their truſt, and many thought it their duty; ſo that the <hi>Cities daily revolted</hi> from his obedience.<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>94.</hi> fin.</note> At Bourdeaux the Jeſuites for a conſpiracy and tumult raiſed there, were by the Preſident of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince expelled the City, to prevent the like for the future.

                     <hi>the King</hi> is not idle, but <hi>treats with his Neighbour</hi> Princes and States <hi>for men and money,</hi> and to mitigate the fury of his own people,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:31919:114"/> with great importunity and ſubmiſſion, <hi>ſolicits for abſolution</hi> for killing the Cardinal, from the Pope, who was highly enra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged againſt him, for that ſacrilegious act as he pretended, but probably more for killing the Duke, if that be true which the State of Venice, and the Dukes of Tuſcany and Mantua cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified the King, that <hi>the Pope and the Duke</hi> had <hi>agreed in ſecret</hi> to marry the Pope's Niece to Prince Jonvil the Duke's Son, and to depoſe the King, thruſt him into a Monaſtery, and make the Duke King in his place. His <hi>Ambaſſador</hi> going about this affair to Rome, was by the way <hi>admoniſhed by the Duke of Tuſcany,</hi> that the King ſhould do well to truſt more to his own forces and ſtrength at home, than to the Pope's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; for if things ſucceedeed well with him in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of thoſe commotions in France, he ſhould have friends enough at Rome, and among them the Pope himſelf; but if otherwiſe, he ſhould find them his bitter enemies. And ſo it proved, for when this proud and inſolent Pope, to gratifie his own pride and ambition, and magnify his authority in the opinion of the people, had drawn on the King and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to do all acts of ſubmiſſion and baſe proſtration to him, as far as he could, he turned him off at laſt without any abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and not not long after began to proceed to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication againſt him. Wherefore <hi>the King,</hi> when he could obtain no favour from the Pope,<note place="margin">Thu. l. <hi>95.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>treats more openly with the King of Navar, and concludes an agreement with him,</hi> to the no little joy of all ſober men, who thought there was no ſuch way for ſetling that Kingdom, as by this reconciliation of the King of France with Navar, the firſt Prince of the Bloud, the next Heir of the Crown, and an excellent General and Commander. Had he done this at firſt rather than ſo baſely and foully broak his Faith, he had certainly by God's bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing (which he might then with more reaſon have expected) prevented the growth of this faction of the League to this height, and moſt of this trouble to himſelf and his Kingdoms. But this now afforded new matter for the Preachers, and Writers to exaſperate the minds of the people withal. And the Pulpits ring, and the Preſſes ſweat with virulent Sermons and Books againſt the two Kings. Among thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtirred
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:31919:114"/> themſelves in this kind, were Father Comolet the Jeſuit, Genebrard, Fr. Feu-ardentius, and Bucherus famous for his Book de Juſta Henrici 3 Abdicatione, and many others men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by our Author. And in their Sermons, beſides thoſe ways of moving the people by ſtirring up their paſſions of fear and hatred, they had another part to act, which was to encourage them to action by moving their hopes and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctations, and this was done by acquainting them with the victories and happy progreſs, and proſperous ſucceſs of their Armies and friends abroad, amplifying the ſame as much as might be. And what-ever news came, whether good or bad, the Preachers were generally the publiſhers of it; if good, to magnify, and ſet it out to the beſt advantage; if bad, to repreſent it to the people as occaſion ſerved, partly comforting and encouraging them under the misfortune, and partly ſtirring them up to more forwardneſs, and greater aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the War. So that theſe matters were the general and ordinary ſubject of their Sermons. And beſides theſe good ſervices which they performed ſeverally, the famous <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Sorbon</hi> it ſelf, by a publick Decree <hi>order</hi> that <hi>the Kings name, and the Prayers</hi> for him <hi>be put out of the Canon of the Maſs,</hi> and inſtead thereof, other Prayers for the Catholick Princes be inſerted, and that thoſe who ſhall ſay Maſs other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by this Decree is appointed, ſhall be held for excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, &amp;c. And not to be wanting to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his devoted Sons in ſo meritorious undertakings, their good Father <hi>the Pope ſends out his Monitory</hi> againſt the King, whereby he is excommunicate, unleſs within ten days he will do the Leaguers the kindneſs to ſet at liberty the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of Bourbon, whom they, having already agreed to the depoſing of him, may ſet up for their King; and moreover make his ſubmiſſion within the term of 60 days from the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of the Monitory, which was poſted up in Rome the 23 of May,<note place="margin">Da. p. <hi>811.</hi>
                     </note> and within a few days after publiſhed at Meaux ten leagues from Paris. Theſe dealings of the Pope with the King ſeemed ſo hard and unreaſonable to <hi>the Princes of Italy,</hi> that they adviſed the King no longer to treat with him as a ſuppliant,<note place="margin">Thu. p. <hi>430.</hi>
                     </note> but to deal with him according to his own rough

                     </note> But the King was not a little grieved at it, and ſaid, <q>That he thought it very hard that he who had ever fought and laboured for Religion ſhould be raſhly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated becauſe he would not ſuffer his own throat to be cut by the arms of his Rebel-ſubjects; and that thoſe who had<note n="*" place="margin">Charles V. an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, <hi>1527.</hi>

Thus were five Kings in a continued ſucceſſion cut off, beſides three others of the ſame line, (the youngeſt ſon of Francis 1. in few months after the beginning of thoſe perſecutions, at his age of 23. and the ſecond and youngeſt of Hen. 2.) who never came to the Crown, and their whole line and poſterity extirpated in France, while they ſought the extirpation of the Proteſtants there; whereby the Crown at laſt, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all oppoſition and endeavours to hinder it, deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to a Proteſtant Prince; and all this by a conſtant courſe of Divine Vengeance upon that Family for about 44 years, for ſo long it was from the execution of the Decree of the Parliament of Province, Apr. 1545. and the death of the King's youngeſt ſon Sept. 8. following, to the murder of Henr. 3. Aug. 1589. the very ſame ſpace of time which <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> happily and proſperouſly reigned in England, and moſt of it contemporary. Wherein it is very plain and obſervable <hi>a triple difference between her and them,</hi> viz. a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent cauſe, or end and aim of their actions, a different manner of proceeding, and a different ſucceſs. As to the <hi>Cauſe;</hi> they deſigned and endeavoured the ſuppreſſion of the reformed Religion, and extirpation of the Profeſſors of it in their ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.; ſhe eſtabliſhed and promoted it in her Dominions.
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:31919:118"/> As to their <hi>manner of proceeding;</hi> they fought to attain their ends by fraud and violence, ſlaughters and inexecrable ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, either without Law, or contrary to Law, or by executions exceeding in ſeverity the very rigour of the Decrees, Laws or Edicts againſt the Proteſtants; and all for no other cauſe but <hi>their Religion;</hi> a Religion which teacheth nothing diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to God or Chriſt, or injurious to man; which embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth all that can reaſonably be proved to have been taught by Chriſt or his Apoſtles; receiveth, honoureth, and commends to the diligent ſtudy of all the ſacred Scriptures; ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as they who perſecute it, confeſs to be true in what it affirms, and is the moſt eſſential part of their own, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves not what they are not ſufficiently convinced to be true, and with no little reaſon ſuſpect to be falſe, or not propoſed to their belief by Divine authority. She did nothing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, or contrary to the Laws; was very moderate in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, and no leſs in executing any Laws againſt Papiſts: The firſt ſhe made in the firſt and fift years of her Reign, being ſo far from introducing any new ſeverity, that they take off from the harſhneſs of what was in force before; and thoſe and the reſt not being made againſt their Religion in general, but upon ſpecial and particular, neceſſary and urgent occaſions, for the neceſſary aſſerting and preſervation of her own juſt authority againſt thoſe who endeavoured to ſet up a preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded foreign juriſdiction againſt her, to abſolve her ſubjects from all duty and obligation of obedience to her, and excite them to rebellions, and to joyn with foreign enemies, or by aſſaſſination to deſtroy her; whereby ſhe was neceſſitated and forced, through their continual wicked, ſeditious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious practices, for the curbing and reſtraining of them, to proceed, contrary to her own diſpoſition, to more and more ſeverities of Laws, which, though none of them made without juſt cauſe, and ſome ſpecial provocation, yet were executed with admirable moderation; the next, after thoſe above mentioned, which was made in the thirteenth year of her Reign,<note place="margin">V. Camd. an. 1577. p. 286.</note> being occaſioned by the Northern Rebellion, and the Pope's Bull, to abſolve her ſubjects from their obedience; yet notwithſtanding in ſix whole years after was not put in

There might alſo be obſerved a great difference between the actions of the Proteſtants in France, and the Papiſts both here and there too, but that, for brevity ſake, ſhall be left to the Readers own obſervation from what hath been related of each. Therefore laſtly, as to their ſucceſs, they, while by fraud and violence they ſought the utter extirpation of the Reformed Religion, and Profeſſors of it in France, were themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated there, and the laſt of their race cut off by his own Subjects of that ſame Religion, which by thoſe wicked courſes was ſought to be eſtabliſhed, and the Religion which they ſought to ſuppreſs and extirpate, took deeper root, and flouriſhed more, notwithſtarding all their oppoſition and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions: She, while, with rare moderation, and a generous plain-dealing conſtancy and reſolution, eſtabliſhed the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Religion, both eaſily and happily attained her end,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:31919:119"/> and was her ſelf eſtabliſhed in her Throne, and in a long, happy, and proſperous Reign, as long as all theirs from the beginning of their perſecutions, preſerved from all the ſecret plots, and machinations, and open rebellions, and aſſaults of her enemies, made victorious over all, and at laſt brought to her grave in peace, and in a good old age, leaving her King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms in peace, and in a flouriſhing condition, and a bleſſed and glorious memory behind her; while they were cut off in the flower or middle of their age, and left their Kingdom embroiled in Civil Wars, Confuſion and Miſery, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous memory of their no leſs unſuccesful, than perfidious and barbarous actions.</p>

This was 20 years after he had firſt profeſſed himſelf Head of the Proteſtants, 13 years after he had again returned to the profeſſion of that Religion wherein he had been bred and educated; when he

The next day after this was <hi>an Edict</hi> made <hi>in favour of the Proteſtants,</hi> with the general conſent of all as neceſſary, publiſhed, whereby the Edict of July was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked, and the former Edicts in favour of the Proteſtants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored. And very fair they were to have created a Patriarch of their own in France, which the Senate urged, but was op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by the new Cardinal of Bourbon, a man of no worth, who was out of hope of being the man himſelf, and was a promoter of a new faction of the Thirdlings among the King's party, yet in thoſe things which concerned the Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Benefices, they gave that power to the Arch-Biſhop which the Pope had uſurped or pretended. The King in a ſpeech to a great Aſſembly of the Nobility and Officers of his Army, upon the death of the former King, had told them, that of thoſe things which,<note place="margin">Thu. l. 97.</note> as they knew, his Predeceſſor had at his death recommended to him, this was the chief, <hi>That he ſhould maintain his Subjects of the Roman Catholick, and of the Reformed Religion in equal liberty,</hi> (aequabili in libertate)

                     <hi>till by the authority of a lawful Oecumenical or National Council ſomething ſhould be decreed concerning that difference, which he would religiouſly obſerve:</hi> and profeſſed before them all, <hi>that he had rather that day ſhould be his laſt, than to do any thing whereby he might be ſaid to waver in his Faith, or to have renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that Religion which hitherto he had profeſſed, before he ſhould be further inſtructed by a lawful Council, to whoſe authority he did ſubmit himſelf:</hi> and therefore he gave free leave to thoſe who were not ſatisfied with this to depart, adding; <hi>and when they have forſaken me, yet God will never forſake me who, I call your ſelves to witneſs, from my childhood hath as it were led me by the hand, and heaped upon me great and unconceivable benefits. Nor did the beneficence of God toward David appear greater, or more miraculous, than when beyond the expectation of all, through ſo many difficulties and dangers he brought me to the Throne; ſo that I ought not in the leaſt to doubt, but he who break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through ſo many obſtacles hath called me to the Kingdom, will preſerve me in it, and defend me againſt all the aſſaults of my enemies, &amp;c. I value not the Kingdom of France, no, nor the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the whole World ſo much, that for the obtaining of them I would make any defection from that Religion, which as true I have from my tender years imbibed with my Mothers milk, and embrace any other faith than what, as I have ſaid before ſhould be reſolved in a lawful Council.</hi> The like confidence in God,<note place="margin">Da. p. 900.

Yet notwithſtanding, after all this, whether through the importunity of the Roman Catholicks of his own party, or the violence of his enemies, who were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to elect a Catholick King, which was much urged by the Pope and the King of Spain, he fell off from his conſtancy,<note place="margin">Thu. l. 106, 107.</note> and without the determination or inſtruction of any lawful General or National Council, <hi>changed his Religion,</hi> and at laſt alſo <hi>ſubmitted himſelf to</hi> the Pope.

<pb n="137" facs="tcp:31919:122"/> his luſt, and the enjoyment of a<note n="†" place="margin">Gabrielle d'Eſtrees, v. Perefix, p. 194.</note> woman; it is no wonder if he did the ſame for the enjoyment of a Kingdom, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he might have better ſecured otherwiſe, and his life with it. It is true, he <hi>never went ſo far as to perſecute the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants,</hi> as his Predeceſſors in the Kingdom of France did, and his Father began to do, and perhaps had proceeded further, had he eſcaped that fatal wound; but while he took liberty to himſelf to change that profeſſion, gave them the liberty to retain and enjoy it, and under better conditions than ever they enjoyed, or were granted them before, which was a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal cauſe which made his Reign ſo much more proſperous and happy than theirs. Yet, as in thoſe two particulars, for his luſt, and for his Kingdom, he did forſake his Conſcience and Religion, ſo did God at laſt, after ſeveral fair warnings, forſake and leave him to the<note n="*" place="margin">V.

By this act of his he broke indeed the faction of the Leaguers, and ſo more eaſily quieted his poſſeſſion of the Kingdom, yet had he ſoon an occaſion to immind him how uncertain and ſhort his enjoyment of it was like to be, unleſs ſtill preſerved in the midſt of Peace by the ſame Providence by which he had been hitherto preſerved in his Wars, and advanced to it through ſo many dangers and difficulties.<note place="margin">Thu. l. 107.</note> For within a month after his converſion to the Romiſh profeſſion, was apprehended an aſſaſin, <hi>Peter Barrier,</hi> who from place to place had followed him to kill him. This fellow had confered about it with a Carmelite and a Capu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, who both encouraged him to it, and when he made ſome ſcruple by reaſon the King was turned Catholick, as he ſaid, he was confirmed in it by Chr.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:31919:123"/> the Jeſuites Colledge, who eaſed him of all ſcruples, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther animated him to perform the undertaking, and when he had been confeſſed, and received the Sacrament in their Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, diſmiſſed him to that purpoſe. Having provided him a knife for the purpoſe, it was not long before he had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to have done it, but was ſtrangely reſtrained, being pulled back as it were with cords tied about his heart, as he afterward confeſſed. The like opportunities he often had at other places whither he followed the King for that purpoſe, but was by ſome little accident or other ſtill prevented, or had not the power to do it, though otherwiſe a fearleſs man. At laſt being diſcovered and apprehended, and brought to his trial, he confidently confeſſed the whole matter, railing upon the Sectaries and his Judges. Before his execution, he was ordered to be racked to make him confeſs his complices; but in the mean time it was thought fit to ſend ſome to him to admoniſh him of his error, whereof he was ſo throughly convinced by Oliver Barengarius, a Dominican, who had all along been of the King's party, that acknowledging his er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, he reckoned himſelf happy that he was prevented from committing ſo great a wickedneſs as he intended, though by his own moſt miſerable death, deteſting his purpoſe, and thoſe who had perſwaded him to it, and told him <hi>that if he died in the enterprize, his ſoul ſhould immediately be received by Angels into Heaven, there to enjoy an eternal happineſs with God,</hi> and admoniſhed him, <hi>that if he ſhould happen to be taken and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, he ſhould not name any of them who had perſwaded him to it, for then he muſt know, he ſhould incur the pains of eternal damnation:</hi> and before his execution he gave notice of two Prieſts, who at Lions had undertaken to kill the King, and, for the greater caution, deſcribed their perſons. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed the odium of the Jeſuits, who were reputed not only to have been the<note n="*" place="margin">So Dav. in the Story of Chaſtel, calls them the firſt authors and continual fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentors of the League, p. 1232.</note> firſt inventers of this miſchievous War, but alſo, what by their profane Sermons, what by the poiſon of their naughty Doctrine ſecretly in confeſſion inſtilled into the minds of the inraged people, to have expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, by a pernitious example, the ſacred perſons of Princes to be murdered by every one. The next danger of this kind
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:31919:123"/> which he was in came yet a little nearer to him,<note place="margin">Thu. l. 111.</note> when in the Chamber of his<note n="†" place="margin">Perefix, p. 229.</note> beloved Miſtreſs, happily at the inſtant, ſtooping to ſalute a Gentleman that came in, he received that ſtroke only at his mouth, and without greater hurt than the loſs of a tooth, which was deſigned at his heart by <hi>John Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtel a Scholar of the Jeſuites,</hi> who, through a flagitious life grown deſperate, hoped by ſo heroick an act for the cauſe of the Roman Catholick Religion, to merit, though not Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof he deſpaired, yet ſome mitigation of his puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, perhaps from the eighth degree to the fourth. He was educated and ſtudied in the Jeſuites School, and was aſſiſtant in Philoſophy to John Guerret a Prieſt of that Society; and though vitious above his age, yet was in eſteem with thoſe Fathers, who uſed to admit him among their choice diſciples, to their more ſecret conferences and religious exerciſes; and had often heard in that Society, that it was not only lawful to kill the King, but a thing much conducing to the cauſe of Religion, whereof it ſeems he was ſo throughly perſwaded, that notwithſtanding the terribleneſs of his execution, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed no ſigns of ſorrow or repentance; but on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, being firſt put to the rack, gave out ſuch aſſertions as the Court declared ſeditious, contrary to the word of God, and condemned by the ſacred Decrees, and made it treaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them. As he had before freely confeſſed,<note place="margin">Da. p. 1332.</note> ſo when he was tortured he confirmed the ſame, that he was bred up in the Schools of the Jeſuites, and had often heard it diſcourſed, and diſputed, that it was not only lawful, but alſo meritorious, to kill Henry of Bourbon (the King) a relapſed Heretick, and often ſaid that he learned that Doctrine from them. Whereupon their Colledge being ſearched, among the papers of <hi>F. John Guignard</hi> were found many writings that taught that Doctrine, many things againſt the late King, and that praiſed the murder of him; and likewiſe againſt the preſent King, that perſwaded the killing of him, and tending to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and parricide: <hi>that it would be well done to thruſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>var, though profeſſing the Catholick Religion, into a Monaſtery, there to do penance: if without war he cannot be depoſed, war is to be made againſt him; if war cannot be made, he muſt by any

When the Guiſians, who highly favoured this new Society, carrying all before them, they reſumed the buſineſs again, and firſt <hi>the Biſhop of Paris,</hi> Euſt.

But the Parliament thought fit rather to remit the whole buſineſs to a General Council, or to a Convention of the Gallicane Church. And at a great meeting of the Biſhops at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at Poiſy, they were <hi>admitted to teach,</hi> but under many <hi>conditions</hi> to change their name, be ſubject to the Biſhop of the

And it was argued on both ſides in full Parliament, by Pet. Verſorius for the Society, highly commending their Original and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and by <hi>Steph.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:31919:126"/> Arch-Biſhops, Biſhops, Curates and others the Prelates of the Church; that notwithſtanding thoſe Jeſuites made ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the Senate to be incorporated into the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and the cauſe being heard the Senate ſuſpended the the Suit, <hi>Salvo partium jure,</hi> ſo that nothing in the interim ſhould be innovated in the cauſe in prejudice of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree; that yet the Jeſuites have not only not at all obeyed the Decree of the Court, but forgetting their ſacerdotal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion have thruſt themſelves into publick buſineſſes, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried themſelves as ſpies for the Spaniards, and managed their concerns: and therefore <hi>pray,</hi> that ſince all theſe things are openly and publickly known, the Senate will interpoſe their authority, and by their Decree command that Sect to depart not only from the Univerſity of Paris, but out of the Kingdom, and exterminate them thence.</q> Hereupon, after various delays by the Jeſuites, <hi>the cauſe came again to an hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> in the Parliament, not openly, but at the inſtance, and through the importunity of the Jeſuites and their friends, the dores being ſhut.

That the principal <hi>Vow</hi> of theſe men is, to be abſolutely and in all things obedient to <hi>the General of their Order,</hi> who for the moſt part is a Spaniard, or ſubject
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:31919:126"/> of Spain, as appears from the ſeries of thoſe who for theſe 50 years from the beginning of their Society, have been their Generals; for ſuch were, 1.

Aquanina: that to <hi>their vow</hi> theſe horrible words are annexed, in which they profeſs to acknowledge Chriſt as preſent in their General: that their Sect, whereas in Italy and France at the beginning it was generally oppoſed, was with great applauſe approved in Spain; they pray day and night for the ſafety and proſperity of the pious, prudent, vigilant Catholick King of Spain, who oppoſeth himſelf as a wall of defence for the houſe of God &amp; the Catholick Faith; but for the moſt Chriſtian King of France never: and let the F. General ſay the word that the King of France ſhould be killed, the command of the Spaniard muſt ex voti ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitate be obeyed. That though upon their petition at Rome for the Popes Confirmation an. 1539. they were at firſt oppoſed, yet at laſt obtained it, this <hi>fourth vow</hi> being added to it, that they ſhould be ready to obey the Pope at a beck, which is that which doth ſo much ingratiate them at Rome, but ought to make them ſo much the more ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in France. And that <hi>their Counſels tend to the ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Kingdom</hi> is hence manifeſt, that when ever the <hi>Popes exceeding their authority,</hi> have ſent out their cenſures againſt the Kingdom of France, there have not been wanting pious men, who with the common ſuffrage of the Gallican Church, have couragiouſly oppoſed ſuch their raſh attempts, (as he ſhews more at large from divers inſtances in the times of Carolus Calvus, Ludovicus Pius, Philippus Pulcher, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolus vi, and Ludovicus xii.) but now in theſe late tumults it hath fallen out quite contrary, the ſacred Order being corrupted with the venom of this ſect, and taught, <hi>that be who is once choſen Pope, although of the Spaniſh Nation or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and a ſworn enemy to the French, may notwithſtanding give up the whole Kingdom for a prey, and abſolve the French from their Faith and Obedience which they owe to their Prince.</hi> That this is a ſchiſmatical and deteſtable opinion, altogether contrary to the word of God, (who hath divided the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:31919:127"/> power from the ſecular as far as Heaven is from the Earth) and as much repugnant to the ſafety and conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Kingdoms, as it is certain that the true Chriſtian Religion is neceſſary thereunto. That theſe monſters have kindled theſe furies in the minds of the French, and excited ſo many ſlaughters and horrid confuſions every where. Hence that publick aſſertion of Tanquerellus 33 years ſince,<note place="margin">V. ſupra ſect. 41. p. 66.</note> 
                        <hi>that the Popes may declare the King's ſubjects free from their Oath of Fidelity.</hi> Hence that reſolution 5 years ſince, by the greater number of the Colledge of Sorbon, that is, thoſe who were new moulded in the ſhop of the Jeſuites, <hi>that Subjects may be abſolved from their Obedience to their Prince.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">V. ſect. 53.</note> That this Vow inſtituted by the Caſtilians (of Spain), which with ſo ſtrait a tye binds mens conſciences to the perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of any kind of enterprize, and to the killing of Kings themſelves by ſuborned emiſſaries, hath diſſolved and wholly aboliſhed the glorious inſtitutes of our Anceſtors, the Laws of the Realm, and the liberties of the Gallican Church: whereas we have received this Law from our Anceſtors, that the Oath of Fidelity, whereby the Subjects of France are obliged to their Kings, can by no cenſures of the Popes be diſſolved; which is ſo conjoyned with the ſafety and weal of the Kingdom, that without certain ruine it cannot be ſevered from it: that the Royal Power in that ſuffers no rival, nor admits any equal Juriſdiction. That theſe emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and aſſertors of this exceſſive power in the Pope crept in inſenſibly at firſt in ſmall numbers into France, but in ſhort time filled the whole Kingdom, and with ſecret frauds and ſeditious Sermons have ſtirred up the wars. That the firſt Conſpiracies, more pernitious than the Bacchanals and that of Cataline, were hatched in their Colledge at Paris; that the Spaniſh Agents did often ſecretly convene there; that there the Nobility at their ſecret Confeſſions were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned for the expiation (or ſatisfaction) of their ſins, to engage for the League, (viz. by a ſpecial commutation of penance into an heroick act of virtue) and thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed were denied the benefit of abſolution. That by them was the ſedition at Veſuna ſtirred up, and the rebellions at
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:31919:127"/> Agen, Tholouſe, &amp;c. and the Spaniſh Souldiers brought into Paris; that by their counſel the Council of xvi emboldned by the forein Forces, offered the Kingdom of France to the King of Spain, and 13 daies after enſued that deteſtable butchery of the principal Senators. That at their Schools at Lions and afterward at Paris was made the late Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy for the murder of the King, as is atteſted by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of Barriere; for among them they are held for real Martyrs, who lay out their lives for the killing of Kings. Hence F. Commotet the laſt Chriſtmas, taking for his text out of the book of Judges the example of Ehud, who ſlew the King of Moab, and fled away, cried out, We have need of another Ehud, whether Monk, or Souldier, or Lacquey, or Shepherd it matters not. Hence the furious ſpeeches of Bernard and Commotet, calling the King Olo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernes, Moab, Nero, Herod, and every where bawling in their Sermons that the Kingdom may be transferred by Election, &amp;c. That among theſe counterfeit Prieſts it is a ſymbol of their profeſſion, <hi>One God, one Pope, and one King of the Chriſtian World;</hi> meaning the Catholick King, to whom they deſign the univerſal Monarchy of the whole World, ſtirring up every where wars and rebellions, that thereby the vaſt body of that Empire may grow up and devour the leſſer Princes. That by them, Philip King of Spain, when he had long gaped after the Kingdom of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal, and foreſaw that ſo long as the King and Nobility continued in ſafety, he could not obtain his deſires, perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the young King Sebaſtian, having removed his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and faithful friends from him, to ſail into <hi>Affrica,</hi> and raſhly engage in fight upon great diſadvantage, contrary to the opinion of all his party, wherein himſelf and almoſt all the flower of the Portugal Nobility periſhed. Nor did they ceaſe till they had alſo ruined Don Antonio, and till the King of Spain<note n="*" place="margin">V. Harlae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um apud Thu. l. 132.</note> not ſo much by his Arms, as by their Arts, had made himſelf Maſter of the Kingdom.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:31919:128"/> their tender minds, which in that age make the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon them, and under a ſhew of Piety teach them to embrue their hands in their Princes bloud, to be diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Magiſtrates, to ſtir up ſeditions among the people, to caſt off all affection to their own Country, and be affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with an adulterous love to foreigners: and being thus ſeaſoned with pernitious errors, they will in time, when grown up, bring the ſame into the Church and State. And indeed already, ſince this new ſect hath as it were ſeized up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the youth, the manners of our Anceſtors have, not by degrees inſenſibly degenerated, but like a torrent been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated into corruption. Nor have whole <hi>Families</hi> eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <hi>ruine</hi> by them, by their arts youths being enveigled from their Parents, and the inheritances and eſtates of their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors transferred to theſe new Lords. The complaints and examples of divers Noble Families thus ſpoiled are known, as of Petrus Aerodius, Mombrunius, Godranus, Bollonius, Largilactonius, the Marques Canilliacus, whoſe Brother was not admitted to his vow in that Society, till they were certain of his ſucceſſion to his elder Brothers Eſtate. And for this purpoſe they have now <hi>their Book of Life,</hi> as they call it, wherein they deſcribe the ſecrets of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, which they learn from confeſſions.</q> Theſe things and much more having largely diſcourſed, in concluſion he urges the neceſſity of a ſpeedy remedy, and therefore prays that according to the ſupplication, the Jeſuites may be decreed to depart the Kingdom within 15 days after denunciation to the ſeveral Schools. Some days after was <hi>Ludovicus Dolaus</hi> heard for the Curates (or Miniſters) who alſo became Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs in the Suit,<note place="margin">Id.

Power to make new Statutes, and to change thoſe which their Founder had eſtabliſhed; alſo to abſolve hereticks, which, if the Pope contend, is more than the whole Gallican Church can do. By Paul, 4. To abſolve penitents from all kind of crimes, even thoſe which are not comprehended <hi>in Bulla Coenae Dominicae,</hi> and from thoſe alſo which the holy See hath reſerved to it ſelf, and
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:31919:128"/> 
                        <hi>pro tempore</hi> to commute vows and pilgrimages, &amp;c. by Jul. 3. to give indulgence from faſts and prohibited meats. Laſtly by Greg. 13. to converſe with ſectaries, and for that purpoſe to wear ſecular habits, (viz. for a diſguiſe) a thing prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the S. Canons; and to correct all kind of Books, and ſo to mend the writings of the Fathers, wherein what Plagiaries they have been, is known to them who converſe with Books; that from thence have great confuſions been brought into the Church, and the Diſcipline generally been diſſolved; for by the Breve of Paul 3. the people are allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave their own Paſtors, and run after them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Sacraments from them; to whom Greg. hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted (authority) to animadvert as well upon the Clergy as the people, that all may be done rightly, and after the Roman mode; ſo that from Prieſts, whether regular or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular it is uncertain, they are ſuddenly become univerſal Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the people, or rather wandering vagabond Biſhops, <hi>(Periodentas &amp; circumcelliones &amp; hamaxarios Epiſcopos)</hi> that there is nothing which they cannot now do at Rome, where they are called <hi>the Popes eyes;</hi> mentis Pontificiae oculi): that <hi>their Principles</hi> are inconſiſtent with the French: that it is certain that to them is principally given in charge that they ſhould oppreſs the Gallican liberty, at firſt by guile, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards with open force, even as in theſe laſt wars they have endeavoured to do; that with them they are reckoned anathema who take the Kings part, but that the French think the contrary, and that not to obey the King is as to reſiſt God, and to fight againſt Heaven: that they think that the Pope may excommunicate Kings and People when he pleaſeth; but the French on the contrary hold them for Sectaries who think that the Pope may interpoſe his autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in any difference of State: that they attribute to the Pope an infinite power over all Kingdoms, and ſet him above the Church, above Councils, and in fine, make his power equal to his will, (to do what he pleaſe): but the French hold his power to be finite, or limited. And for <hi>their good deeds and practices,</hi> that Claud Matthew, a ring-leader of the faction, whom Henr. 3. had familiarly uſed in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:31919:129"/> devotions, and who therefore was well acquainted with his piety (and devotion to the Rom. Cath. Religion) with great impiety and ingratitude went to Rome, and would have perſwaded Greg. 13. to have excommunicated him, unleſs he would comply with the leaders of that pernitious faction, which being denied by him, was after his death ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of his ſucceſſor Sixtus: that Varada of the ſame ſociety confirmed Barriere in his purpoſe to kill the King, when he made ſome ſcruple at it; that they confeſs as much, but with frivolous cavillation ſeek to excuſe it. Nor are theſe the faults of ſingle perſons among them, foraſmuch as it is a uſual thing (or conſtant cuſtom) with them, when they have any enterprize in hand, to confer together about it, &amp;c. that by their occult art of <hi>prying into ſecrets</hi> they have by little and little inſinuated themſelves into the minds of the ſimple, and acquired a dominion in their conſciences. Whereof there is a freſh example in the five (Popiſh) Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons of <hi>the Switzers,</hi> whom when the Jeſuites had in vain attempted to draw them from their League with the other Cantons of the Proteſtants, made for their common ſafety, they, leaving the men, like the ſerpent which deceived our firſt Parents, ſet upon the women, and perſwaded them not to lye with their Husbands till they had broken off the League. But the <hi>Switzers</hi> diſcovering the fraud, ſhewed themſelves men, and handled the Conſpirators according to their deſert. The <hi>Venetians</hi> likewiſe, whoſe Juſtice and Prudence the duration of their State doth eaſily evince, ſaw as much,<note place="margin">Yet they ſince did it, an. 1607. v. l. 137.</note> and being warned by our example, they did not indeed thruſt them out of their Territories, for how could they do that, being ſo near neighbours to the Pope? but did maturely ſhut them up within their own incloſures, and interdicted them the hearing of confeſſions. And how powerful they are among us by theſe means, they openly profeſs, and glory in it in their letters to their General. But thus is the diſcipline (of the Church) overthrown, and (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the prudent prohibition of the Council of Nants, the ſaying of St. Aug. <hi>Neminem digne poenitere poſſe, quem non ſuſtineat unitas Eccleſiae:</hi> the judgment of the ancient
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:31919:129"/> Chriſtians, who condemned Audius for making ſeparation in the Church) the people ſeduced from their own Paſtors are adulterouſly allured to communion in ſacris with them apart from others, and at laſt ſtirred up to rebellion againſt their Prince, and emiſſaries ſuborned to murder him. Their conſpiracies are well known againſt Prince Maurice, which at laſt took effect; and in England thoſe of Parry, Cullen, York, Wikiams; in Scotland thoſe of James Gordon and Edmond Hay; and with us that ſo often mentioned of Barriere. But among the ancient Chriſtians theſe monſters were unheard of. Of the Chriſtians was no Caſſius, no Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, no Albinus, as Tertullian ſpeaks. Nor was that crime ever heard of in France till the coming in of the Jeſuites. For it was brought in by them from Spain, whence they had their original, where the Gothes, as an ancient Author informs us, took up this deteſtable cuſtom, that if any of their Kings pleaſed them not, they put him to the ſword, and ſet up whom they pleaſed in his place.</q> On behalf of the Jeſuites Cl. Dureus rather pleaded in bar of the action, than ſpoke to the merits of the cauſe; but P. Barnius an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered more copiouſly in writing. But, as much of what was ſpoken by the others is here purpoſely omitted for bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſake, ſo thoſe things particularly which I find anſwered by him, except that of Portugal, which notwithſtanding his anſwer, ſeems very probable, as well agreeing with their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and actions, though ſuch myſterious practices are not eaſy to be fully proved. And thus ſtood the caſe with the Jeſuites in France, when the King was about to<note n="*" place="margin">Which was done 17. Jan.</note> proclaim war againſt their great Patron the King of Spain: and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the particular conſideration of theſe or either of theſe, to prevent what they feared might be the conſequence of them<note n="†" place="margin">V. Perefix, 229.</note> did produce that attempt of their Scholar Chaſtel, or not; for he was more deeply ſeaſoned with their principles and inſtructions than to make a full confeſſion; yet certain it is that that attempt did produce a more ſpeedy determination of the cauſe than could otherwiſe have been expected, by a Decree,<note place="margin">29 Dec. 1594. Thu. l. 111.</note> whereby the Court did ordain <hi>that the Prieſts and Students of the Colledge of Clermont</hi> (for they would not call
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:31919:130"/> them by the name of Jeſuites) <hi>and all others of that Society, as corrupters of Youth, perturbers of the publick Tranquillity, and enemies of the King and Kingdom, ſhall within three days after denunciation depart from Paris and all other Cities where they have opened School, and within fifteen days after out of the Kingdom, upon pain to be proſecuted as guilty of Treaſon; and that their Goods and Lands ſhall be imployed for pious uſes, and be diſtributed at the pleaſure of the Court; and all the Kings Subjects were interdicted to ſend their children to the Schools of that Society out of the Kingdom to be inſtructed in Learning, upon pain of Treaſon.</hi> This was executed the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer following.<note place="margin">Li. 112.</note> Some few days after this, was made another Decree, whereby Chaſtel's Father's houſe, which was neer to the Palace, was ordered to be pulled down, and a Pyramid to be erected in the place of it, with the Decree inſcribed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ad aeternam facti memoriam; which was likewiſe done, with other inſcriptions in deteſtation of the crime.<note place="margin">V. l. 134.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="58">58. How neceſſary for the ſafety both of the King and Kingdom this was, and that the Decree ſhould be ſtrictly executed throughout the whole Kingdom, and duly and conſtantly obſerved for the future, many in the Court, and moſt in the Parliament of Paris, and of the Clergy, were very ſenſible, and the King could not be ignorant, eſpecially after ſuch fair warnings. And yet, whereas <hi>the Jeſuites,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by virtue of this Decree exterminated out of the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions of the Court of Paris,<note place="margin">Thu. l. 129.</note> which extends to near half the Kingdom, and likewiſe of Burgundy and Normandy, continued notwithſtanding for three years after to keep up their Schools in the Territories of Tholouſe and Bourdeaux, to which many ſent their Sons to be taught, and many again from that Society, changing their habits as if they had alſo renounced their vow, crept into other Schools; though the King was often importuned to command thoſe Courts by his Edict to publiſh the Decree, and it was once or twice ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved in Council, the execution notwithſtanding was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually retarded by the craft and ſubtilty (ſaith our Author) of ſome about the King, but perhaps ſome thoughts of a peace with Spain, which had been propoſed, might make it
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:31919:130"/> thought unſeaſonable at that time. But the Parliament of Paris was not wanting to do what in them lay,<note place="margin">21 Aug. 1597.</note> and by <hi>another Decree,</hi> under a ſevere penalty prohibited all Cities, Colledges and Univerſities to admit any of that ſociety, though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the renunciation of their vow, to preach, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any ſacerdotal Miniſtery, or to teach children either publickly or privately.<note place="margin">Thu. l. 120.</note> The year following the King was again provoked through the obſtinacy and inſolency of the Court of Tholouſe, to ſend out his Edict commanding thoſe Courts to publiſh the Decree, and was moved by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor Ph. Huraltus Cevernius ſo to do, but by ſome Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, ſays our Author, the buſineſs was at preſent delayed, and at laſt wholly put off; and very likely was now alſo though unſeaſonable in reſpect of the King's deſire to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a diſſolution of his Marriage with the Queen Margaret, that he might marry his beloved Miſtreſs La belle Gabrielle,<note place="margin">Thu. ib. Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix. p. 294.</note> whereof he began about this time to treat with the Pope's Legate. And indeed, though I know not whether ſo much be written by any, yet it ſeems very legible in the actions and occurrences which are written, that this was ſo powerful a motive with him, as made him not only deſiſt from further enforcing the execution of the Decree, and total extermina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jeſuites, but on the contrary to yield to <hi>their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thu. ibid.</note> For the Jeſuites about this time taking occaſion upon a Convention of the Clergy to offer him a ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ceaſed not afterwards till by ſupplications and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations every where ſought, they at laſt obtained their deſire, the Pope's Legates ſparing no pains on their behalf. So our Author, who afterward tells us,<note place="margin">L. 129.</note> that when Ignatius Armandus their Provincial, about a year before they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored, had made a Speech to the King for them, the King anſwered that the buſineſs was now in the Pope's hands, without whoſe direction he would determine nothing <hi>(nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium penes. Pontificem eſſe, quo inconſulto nihil velit decernere).</hi> But it may be more plainly perceived in a paſſage afterward at their reſtitution;<note place="margin">L. 132.</note> for when the Parliament interceded againſt their reſtitution, and were very averſe from publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kings Eidict for that purpoſe, at laſt comes And.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:31919:131"/> Huraltus Meſſius into the Senate, and acquaints them from the King with <hi>the whole ſeries of the buſineſs,</hi> and tells them <hi>that above five years ſince the Pope had dealt with the King that the Jeſuites might be reſtored to the ſame ſtate in the Kingdom wherein they were before the Decree.</hi> This was about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1604, and the King having in the year 1598 treated with the Legate about the diſſolution of his Marriage, as hath been ſaid, in the year 1599; he obtained the Pope's Breve to certain Delegates,<note place="margin">L. 123.</note> who, upon hearing of the cauſe, pronounced the Marriage null ab initio; ſo that this points us to the time exactly: and conſidering the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice of the Court of Rome to neglect no oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of promoting their own ends, it cannot be thought that they would let this go without ſome aſſurance from the King of the reſtitution of the Jeſuites, which at the ſame time was earneſtly ſollicited. It is true that the King's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Miſ. who had engaged him to ſend to the Pope about it, died in Child-birth before the commiſſion to the Delegates was ſent; yet this hinders not but ſhe might before have prevailed with him to give all ſatisfaction to the Pope in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the obtaining of it, and that thereupon he might ſo far have engaged to the Pope, that he knew not afterwards how to get off when he would; and this it ſeems was the true reaſon why the buſineſs hung ſo long, and yet was done at laſt. For thus Meſſius goes on relating the ſeries of the buſineſs, <hi>the King,</hi> ſays he, <hi>put it off from day to day as much as he could,</hi> (he did not refuſe or excuſe himſelf from denying it, but ſought delays) <hi>and when he could no longer ſhift it off,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Quantum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuerat diem de die dixiſſe.</note> 
                     <hi>he propoſed certain articles almoſt uniform to the contents of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, and by his Embaſſador laboured with the Pope to be content with their reſtitution under thoſe conditions. For the Pope de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their univerſal reſtitution throughout the whole Kingdom, but the King offered it in certain places appointed to a certain number, and in the Territories ſubject to the Court of Paris were only two places aſſigned them. From that time two years paſſed without any mention of the buſineſs, whereat the King, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to gratifie the Pope in it, was troubled; at length the King's Ambaſſador being inſtant with the Pope, he anſwered that the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:31919:131"/> articles propoſed by the King ſeemed to him to be ſuch as the Jeſuites ought to be contented with them, but that hitherto he had deferred his anſwer, becauſe the General of the Society</hi> (Aquanina) <hi>ſhewed himſelf not at all ſatisfied with them, nor would ſubſcribe to them, &amp;c. that the buſineſs therefore was no longer in the King's power, but tranſacted by agreement between the King and the Pope; (rem proinde amplius non eſſe integram, ſed de ea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Regem &amp; Pontificem quaſi pacto tranſactum fuiſſe)</hi> All which ſhews ſufficiently that the Pope had then gotten ſome hank upon him which he could not get off. Nor can any other be eaſily aſſigned ſo probable as this which I have ſaid. Only one thing more 'tis likely helped forward the buſineſs, <hi>viz.</hi> a deſire to ſecure his life by ingratiating himſelf with the regicides: for ſo it is ſaid, that when his great favourite the D. of Sully diſſwaded him from their re-admiſſion,<note place="margin">Foul. l. 9. c. 2.</note> he anſwered, <hi>Give me then ſecurity for my life.</hi> And indeed though in his anſwer to that grave ſpeech of the chief Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident Harlay in the name of the Parliament, and in behalf of the Univerſity, repreſenting to him, both from their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practices, the danger of what he was about, not only to the Kingdom, but to his own perſon, he made ſhew of great contempt of that danger, and hopes, which upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation he had conceived of the good fruits which France might receive from their reſtitution, and alſo of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in God, who had thus preſerved him hitherto, for his future preſervation; yet ſince it does plainly appear by what was delivered by Meſſius from him to the Senate, (and there can be no reaſon to think otherwiſe) that he was ſore againſt his will, (viz. through ſome inconſiderate pre-ingagement from which he could not recede) brought to it, his other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to them beſides their re-admiſſion, may be thought to proceed from this principle, and his ſhew of contempt of the danger to argue rather what he ſought to conceal, than what he pretended, or at leaſt that that contempt proceeded from his hopes of ſecuring his own ſafety by this means. For, what-ever he pretended, it could not proceed from a well grounded <hi>confidence of God's protection;</hi> a thing incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his living in continued known ſin by reaſon of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:31919:132"/>

For who can with confidence expect any favour from him, whom he doth daily knowingly injure and offend? Beſides, that confidence is not always the meer reſult of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, but is often raiſed in pious ſouls by the ſpecial influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Spirit of God, who as he doth more and more encreaſe it in thoſe who continually and ſincerely endeavour to perſevere and go forward in a diligent obſervance of his will, and to raiſe their ſouls by a conſtant exerciſe of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Reaſon and Faith, above the animal or bruitiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; ſo doth he always withdraw the ſame from thoſe who decline to bruitiſh affections, and if they go on ſo to do, at laſt leaves them diſ-ſpirited,<note place="margin">Quos perdere vult Jupiter dementat pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us.</note> and obnoxious to baſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful ſhifts and devices, whereby they pull down miſchief upon their own heads, eſpecially when this is mixt with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude againſt great mercies. Nor can a ſacrilegious and profane abſolution, by thoſe who cry peace, peace, when there is no peace, ſerve the turn, without a due repentance propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the fault with all its aggravations, and a ſound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. And for what fruits he might expect from their reſtitution, for the good of the Kingdom, his Parliament well informed him by the mouth of their worthy Preſident Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, in that notable ſpeech which might well have deſerved a larger place here, had not ſo much been related already to that purpoſe from others. <hi>As they have all one common Name and Vow, ſo have they, ſaith he, certain heads of Doctrine wherein they all agree: as, that they acknowledge no Superior beſides the Pope, and to him they give Faith and an abſolute Obedience, and firmly believe that the Pope hath power to excommunicate Kings; but that a King excommunicate is a Tyrant, and that his ſubjects may with impunity make inſurrection againſt him. That every one of them who is initiated though but in the lower Orders of the Church, whatſoever crime he commits, cannot poſſibly incur the crime of Treaſon, becauſe they are not at all any longer the King's Subjects, nor ſubject to his Juriſdiction. Thus are the Eccleſiaſticks by their Doctrine exempt from the ſecular Power,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:31919:132"/> and lawfully may with impunity lay bloudy (violent) hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſacred perſons of Kings. This they aſſert in printed Books, &amp;c. Theſe falſe and erroneous Doctrines cannot be admitted by Kings, and therefore it behoves that they who maintain them ſhould before all things renounce the ſame in their Schools. If they do not, they ought by no means to be ſuffered, as thoſe who maintain a Doctrine deviſed to the ſubverſion of the fundamentals of royal power and authority. If they do, yet are they not much more to be truſted; for at Rome and in Spain, where theſe new monſtrous opinions flouriſh, they think one thing, but ſpeak</hi>

But all would not do; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the interceſſion of the Parliament, the depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Univerſity, the diſſwaſions of thoſe he held both able and faithful to him; he had made an Edict, and it muſt be publiſhed, and the Jeſuites reſtored, mal-gre meſme les avis de quelques uns de ſon Conſcil. And they muſt not only be reſtored, but moreover have a new Colledge built them at La Fleſche, which the King endowed with an annual Rent of 11000 Crowns (Aurei) and prevailed with the Clergy for 100000 more toward the building of it; and he alſo orders that the hearts of Himſelf, his Queen, and their Succeſſors ſhall be there intombed in a Church to be built by himſelf; and in the mean time a Father of that Society is admitted to the inſpection and conduct of his own, being made his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Preacher and Confeſſor, viz.

                  <p n="59">59. But before we proceed to the murder it ſelf of this King, it will be neceſſary to take notice of ſome <hi>other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies</hi> againſt him, whereof ſome were contemporary with thoſe of Barriere and Chaſtel, though not diſcovered till afterward, and ſome were ſince. The firſt <hi>of Nic. Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicinus</hi> the Pope's Legate reſident with the Arch-Duke at Bruxels, who having every where ſought for an aſſaſſine, at laſt light upon <hi>Ch. Ridicone</hi> a Dominican Friar of Gant, who was very ready to lay down his life for the cauſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; but before he would undertake this buſineſs, deſired in the firſt place to have the authority of the Pope and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal's approbation; wherefore the Legate for his ſatisfaction gave him a writing under his hand in the name of the Pope and Cardinals, to that purpoſe; and having furniſhed him with Mony, and bleſſed him with the ſign of the Croſs, he diſmiſſed him, giving him alſo for his better ſecurity from diſcovery, a faculty or diſpenſation to wear a ſecular habit, of a Souldier, and to ride, dance, fence, &amp;c.

In
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:31919:134"/> his journey at Vermand he underſtood that the King was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to the Church, and came to the Crown by lawful ſucceſſion, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1593</label> yet he went on as far as St. Denys, but from thence returned to Bruxels to the Legate, and gave him this reaſon of his return; whereat the Legate ſhaked his head, and tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that the Bearnois (ſo he called the King) and all his party ſtood ſtill excommunicated by the Pope, perſwaded him to perſevere in his purpoſe; to whom Ridicone an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, if I could ſee the Pope's mandate, then it ſhould ſoon be conſidered on. At the ſame time <hi>Pet.

Some time after <hi>Ridicone,</hi> with whom a ſervant of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates had afterward dealt in ſecret, went alſo to Rome, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Malavicinus had returned, where being by him confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in his purpoſe, he took his journey by Milan, and having there communicated the buſineſs to the Spaniſh Miniſters, he came into France about the ſame time that Alex.

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1596</label> the King being then reconciled not only to the Church but to the Pope alſo.

Being returned to Gaunt, he reſumed his former deſign of killing the King, and after ſome ſecret conference at the Monaſtery of St. Vincent in the King of Spain's Territories, he returned again into France, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">year </seg>1599</label> where being again apprehended, he was condemned and executed. At his Trial being asked how he could think of ſuch a thing as to kill the King, he anſwered, that <hi>by the frequent Sermons from the Pulpit, and daily Diſputations in the School, which he heard; and moreover the praiſes of James
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:31919:134"/> Clemont, as of a glorious Martyr who had devoted himſelf for the liberty of the French, every where reſounding, not only at the Churches, but in the Markets, Streets, and at Feaſts; he was eaſily perſwaded that he ſhould do a thing pleaſing and acceptable to God, who ſhould kill the cruel Tyrant, who without any right tore in pieces that moſt Chriſtian Kingdom with the loſs of ſo many ſouls; and therefore when Malavicinus did moreover furniſh him with the authority of God and the Pope to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, he readily undertook it;</hi> being put to the rack he made no other onfeſſion than he had done before. At the ſame time was alſo executed one <hi>Nic. Anglus</hi> a Capuchin Frier of St. Michel in the Dioceſs of Thoul in Lorrain, being convicted and condemned for the ſame crime. The next year after Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicone was firſt apprehended, and while he was in priſon, <hi>Ledeſma</hi> a Miniſter of the King of Spain, employed one <hi>Pet. Owen</hi> a Carthuſian Frier, who,<note place="margin">Thu. l. 118. 1597.</note> for his diſſolute manners being cenſured in his Monaſtery, had fled into Spain, to ſuborn an emiſſary to murder the King. Owen having treated with a Souldier in the King's Army about it, to whom he had made great promiſes, was himſelf the next year after apprehended and convicted both by witneſſes and by his own confeſſions; but was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by the King in reſpect to the Carthuſians, being ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to have taken the evidence in a judicial manner, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he might when he pleaſed expoſtulate with the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards. But ſhortly after theſe things enſued the <hi>Peace with Spain</hi> at Vervins, and not long after ſome hopes given of the reſtitution of the Jeſuites, which was at laſt granted as we have ſeen: whereupon one might have thought that his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being all either ſubdued or reconciled, having reconciled himſelf to the Church, to the Pope, to thoſe of the League who remained unſubdued, to the Spaniard, and to the Jeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, that he ſhould henceforward have enjoyed his Kingdom, his new Religion which had brought all theſe bleſſings with it, and his Miſſes too, at leaſt his life, in ſafety. But alas, it may be feared he had forgotten to reconcile himſelf truly to his God, which made the reſt but <hi>male facta gratia, que ne quicquam coit &amp; refcinditur:</hi> For; <hi>when a mans ways pleaſe

Thus among others, <hi>Nic. L'Oſte,</hi> whom the Secretary Villeroy employed in decyfering letters, being corrupted by them with an annual penſion of 1200 Crowns, continually diſcovered all the ſecrets of them to the Spaniſh Embaſſador.<note place="margin">L. 128.</note> They had before corrupted the <hi>Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal de Biron,</hi> and ſome other perſons of Quality, which being diſcovered, brought him to his end about two years ſince; and now they not only again ſet upon the Count d'Auvergne, who had been convicted of Biron's conſpiracy,<note place="margin">L 132. &amp; 134.</note> and pardoned, but alſo the <hi>Seigneur d'Entragues,</hi> and the <hi>Marquiſe de Verne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> his beautiful and witty daughter, the King's Miſs, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt them, and that by no meaner or other agents than their Embaſſadors in France, <hi>Jo.

                  <p n="60">60. While the Spaniards are thus active to continue their old, and make new friends in France, it is not likely they would be unmindful of <hi>the Jeſuites,</hi> whom they had always found ſuch ready inſtruments to ſerve them, and in other Countries were ſtill as well affected to the intereſt of Spain and the houſe of Auſtria,<note place="margin">V. l. 135. 136.</note> though contrary to that of their own Countrey, as ever. Nor is it to be thought that the Jeſuites would be ſo eaſily drawn off from their old Friend and Patron, by thoſe little expreſſions of kindneſs, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to compenſate their injuries received; and beſides, might be doubtful whether proceeding from any real affection to them or not; eſpecially conſidering their ſubjection to the ſame F.

When he had redoubled his ſtroke, and offered a third, he never ſo much as ſtirred from the place, or offered to conceal the knife, but ſtood ſtill, as if he deſired to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, and gloried in the exploit; and (which may alſo help to ſatisfie us that he did it <hi>not of his own meer motion</hi>) at his examination,<note place="margin">V. The Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, p. 126. 137.</note> were evident marks found in him of the Doctrine of the Jeſuites, and to the Divines who were ſent to him, he ſhewed himſelf perfectly inſtructed in all their diſtinctions and evaſions about Rebellion and King-killing, though otherwiſe very ignorant in all other Learning. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, at his Execution, ſuch was his conſtancy in the midſt of his terrible tortures, as ſtrongly confirmed the ſuſpition that certain Emiſſaries under the masſque of piety had inſtructed and enchanted him by falſe aſſurances that he ſhould dye a Martyr, if he killed him, whom they made him believe was the ſworn enemy of the Church: and poſſibly he might have been charmed by ſome ſuch incantations as were heretofore uſed to Barriere; and yet, as 'tis ſaid, he did confeſs thus much,<note place="margin">Foal. p. 642.</note> that he had informed Father d'Aubigny of his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded murther, and ſhewed him the knife; but it was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and therefore not to be revealed; and the Jeſuite up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination proteſted that God had given him the grace, that as ſoon as any thing was revealed to him in confeſſion, he preſently forgot it. The Jeſuites were generally ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and cenſured as guilty, and ſeveral ſuſpitious paſſages in their Sermons lately preached, particularly by F. Hardy and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:31919:137"/> F. Gontier, were called to mind: and thereupon the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ordered the Jeſuite Mariana's Book de Rege &amp; Regis Inſtitutione to be burned by the common Executioner:<note place="margin">Continuat. of Serres, p. 1295 Foul. p. 646.</note> and afterward condemned a Book of Suarez (Defenſio Fidei Cath.) as containing many Seditious and treaſonable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; and after this another of another Jeſuite, Ant. Sanctarellus (de Haereſi, Schiſmate, &amp;c.) printed at Rome with the approbation of the General,<note place="margin">Foul. ibid. Moul. ubi ſup.</note> and at the ſame time queſtioned F. Cotton, and other chief men of their Society about their Doctrine in this reſpect; but this was many years after the murder. But that the Hiſtory is ſo ſparing in this particular of the acceſſories, it ſelf gives us a good reaſon; <hi>the Judges themſelves who examined him,</hi> ſays Perefix, <hi>durſt not open their mouths, and never ſpoke of it but with a ſhrug of their ſhoulders;</hi> and that ſome grand thing was huſhed up, may be ſuppoſed from the publick complaint of the Prince of Conde and others five years after, that the diſcovery of this murther was ſtopped, and not fully proſecuted. It ſhould ſeem domeſtick and foreign jealouſies conſpired in it. But that it was not done without the privity of others, is further confirmed from the Predictions of it, the general bruit which fore-ran it, and the King's enemies confident expectation of it. <hi>His enemies,</hi> ſays Perefix, were then in a profound <hi>ſilence;</hi> which poſſibly was not cauſed by their conſternation and fear of the ſucceſs of his arms, but for the expectation they had to ſee ſome great blow, which was all their hope. It was foretold in an Almanack brought to Peireſcius out of Spain, printed November before; which Gaſſendus, though he doubts not but the Artiſt might have ſome dealing with an evil genius, yet thinks he might foreſee by other means, as being privy to the conſpiracy, which indeed is the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it was compoſed by a Beneficiary or Beneficed man of Barcellonia or Barcinonia, from whence the Spaniſh Emiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary above mentioned came to Paris to Father Cotton, by whom he was recommended to the King.<note place="margin">Perefix.</note> And perhaps of the ſame kind with this was that Prediction of his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death by a determinate blow,<note place="margin">Continuat. of Serres.</note> which was found written in a paper upon the Altar at Montargis. The Provoſt of
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:31919:138"/> Pluviers, who, 'tis ſaid, was a Jeſuite in Faction, and had a Son a Jeſuite, being accuſed to have ſaid the ſame day that the King was murthered, that he was ſlain or wounded that day, ſtrangled himſelf in priſon. And indeed ſuch and ſo many were the predictions and reports of it at the time, and before it was done, which are mentioned by<note n="*" place="margin">Li. 2. de vita Peireskii.</note> Gaſſendus, Pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix, and others, as make it very apparent that it was generally fore-known both in Spain and Italy, or at leaſt that there was then many emiſſaries ſent out to do it, and that it was confidently expected that it would certainly be done. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is ſomewhat ſtrange that thoſe <hi>circumſtances,</hi> at his next Solemnity, in his Coach, and the very day of the month, ſhould be ſo preciſely <hi>foretold,</hi> as it ſeems it was in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that he gave credit to it, though no credulous perſon, and was ſo ſad and dejected, that he was like one condemned to death, though by nature neither fearful nor melancholy. He had advertiſements to this purpoſe by his Embaſſadors, and namely by Jo. Bochartus from Venice; and by others from twenty ſeveral places. But it ſeems it was decreed, the Decree was gone out, and it muſt be executed.</p>
                  <p>This end had Henry le Grand in the height of his Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure; much like the fall of ſome ſtately ſtructure deceitfully built upon an infirm foundation, when juſt raiſed to its height. He was frighted in his youth into a change of his Profeſſion, for the ſaving of his life, (the firſt, but bitter fruit of his being unequally yoked) but that being only through teror and conſtraint, he returned again, when he found a convenient opportunity to the open profeſſion of his own Religion. It was about the eighteenth year of his age, when his youth might make his yielding to ſo extraordinary terror, heightned by the ſad ſpectacle of the horrid murthers of all his friends, the more excuſable. About eighteen years after, when he was grown up to maturity, about the thirty ſixt year of his age, and had given ſome teſtimony of his conſtancy in his Profeſſion; and for his encouragement had received no ſmall teſtimonies of Divine favour, not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving and conducting him ſafe through many dangers and difficulties, but leading him by the hand to the poſſeſſion of
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:31919:138"/> the Kingdom, and making way for him by the extirpation of a whole Family, another Trial was aſſigned him by the great Agonothetes;<note place="margin">V. Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus, 2. 1. 2, 3, &amp;c.</note> who never ceaſeth to provide new matter and occaſions of trial and exerciſe for all thoſe who once apply themſelvs to his ſervice, till either by many mutual experiments given and received of their fidelity and conſtancy to him, and of his admirable Providence never failing them, but ordering all for their good, they become more than Conquerors, and well ſetled and confirmed in his ſervice, (one great reaſon of the difficulties and adverſities wherewith good men are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exerciſed) or on the other ſide, after many acts of unfaithfulneſs, whereby their courage and reſolution is more and more broken and abated, they become eaſily affrighted or allured from their duty, and at laſt either wholly deſerting, or little regarding the ſame, are accordingly by him aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned to the deceitful and pernitious courſes of their own luſts and devices. The former was a trial whether he would be frighted or forced from his fidelity; this rather whether he would be allured from it. In the former he failed; and now having had time to repent, and reſume new courage and reſolution, he is again called upon the ſtage; and in the firſt aſſault he behaved himſelf not much amiſs. For, who can miſlike his referring all to the determination and advice of a lawful General, or National Council, had be been ſincere, and continued conſtant in this reſolution?<note place="margin">V. Thu. l. 98. 101, &amp; 103.</note> Nor did he want encouragement in this reſpect from the forward and coura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious oppoſition which on his behalf was made againſt the Pope's Bulls, by his Subjects even of the Roman Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and not only by the Civil Power, but the Clergy alſo concurring therein; who moreover gave him a fair oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, and kind of invitation either by ſetting up a Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch in France,<note place="margin">V. Thu. l. 103.</note> (which had been very agreeable to the firſt flouriſhing ſtate of the Church after the times of Perſecution) or by reſtoring to the Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops their ancient authority (which was in ſome ſort done, and held for four years after) to have caſt of that Antichriſtian yoke of the Papal Uſurpations, (under which he afterwards, neglecting that opportunity, unhappily enſlaved himſelf and his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom)
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:31919:139"/> and ſo having reformed that grand, abominable abuſe, he might with the more facility, afterwards have eſtabliſhed, by the mature deliberation of a lawful Council, ſuch a Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the Gallican Church as perhaps might not have been inferior to any which hath been made in other places. And afterwards,<note place="margin">L. 107.</note> when he reſolved to be reconciled to the Church, they admitted and abſolved him, notwithſtanding the Pope's Legate oppoſed it all he could, contending that he could not be abſolved by any but the Pope. But theſe things which might have given encouragement to a conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and truly pious mind, to conſtancy and further depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon God, to him perhaps proved a further tentation; their fidelity to him making their perſwaſions to change his Religion the more prevalent with him; eſpecially concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with a more powerful motive, viz. the reducing of the reſt of the Kingdom to his obedience. And therefore, though like David he waxed ſtronger and ſtronger, and the League, like the houſe of Saul, waxed weaker and weaker, yet in about half the time that David was kept out of the greateſt part of his Kingdom, he began to yield to the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. And firſt, when the Leaguers, through the incita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Pope and the King of Spain, were about to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble to chooſe a Catholick King, (though that was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to break their party by their emulations and diviſions concerning the perſon) forgetting his former reſolutions, and neglecting his conſcience, inſtead of dependance upon the Divine Providence, he applies himſelf to humane Policies, and reſolves to change his Religion, without ſtaying for the determination of a lawful either General or National Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.<note place="margin">L. 107.</note> And this, after a few hours inſtruction, whereby he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he was much informed of what he was ignorant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, being ſolemnly done, he next, not long after, by a<note n="*" place="margin">L. 107, 108.</note> ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Embaſſador makes ſupplication to the Pope to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his favour. And though he had preſently hereupon two notable experiments, by the attempts of Barriere and Chaſtel, of the vanity and deceitfulneſs of ſuch ſhifts and humane Policies, without the favour of the Divine Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Bleſſing, (beſides a faithful and ſound admonition
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:31919:139"/> from the good Queen Elizabeth) yet his confidence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance upon God, being before weakned, (it commonly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with perverted minds as with corrupted ſtomachs, which turn their natural food and nouriſhment into the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their diſeaſe) theſe did but provoke him to the more earneſt purſuit of humane politick means; and therefore again, when he had already broken the party of the League, and Paris, wherein their chief ſtrength lay,<note place="margin">L. 109. L. 108.</note> had ſubmitted to him, and beſides all this, the Pope had unworthily repulſed his Embaſſador, and given him a juſt provocation, (which certainly he might have improved, with the concurrence and good liking of the French Nobility and Clergy, toward the reformation of that abominable abuſe of the Papacy, which is the original or prop of all the reſt) he was notwithſtanding eaſily wrought upon at the ſlight intimation of the Pope, (who, when he ſaw it was in vain longer to oppoſe him, was very willing to receive his ſubmiſſion) to ſend another Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſie, and baſely proſtrate himſelf to him: baſely I ſay,<note place="margin">L. 113.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is not likely that he did it out of Conſcience or Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but rather out of fear of Emiſſaries and Aſſaſſins, which is<note n="*" place="margin">A percuſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribus, qui quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidie vitae ejus inſidiantur metuentem.</note> expreſly mentioned by his Agents to the Pope, as a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to his reconciliation: and for the ſame reaſon, 'tis likely, as hath been ſhewed before, he at laſt, notwithſtanding all perſwaſions, earneſt interceſſions and ſupplications to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, reſtored the Jeſuites again, and among other favours ſubjected the government of his conſcience to them. This was the foundation upon which he built his Greatneſs, which having laid for his ſecurity, he preſently ſet himſelf to heap up Treaſures, and at laſt raiſed a great Army for the execution of ſome grand deſign, which, whatever it was in truth, he pretended to be for the promotion of the Chriſtian cauſe againſt the Infidels. But alas, all was built upon a ſandy foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation; he had forſaken the rock of his ſalvation, and rely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon vain policies had ungratefully forſaken him, by whom he never had, nor ſhould have been forſaken, ſo long as he continued faithful and conſtant to his duty; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting his conſcience to obtain a ſtaff of reed, had broken the ſtaff of his ſureſt confidence,<note place="margin">Iſa. 36.6.</note> aggravating alſo the offence of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:31919:140"/> his ſpiritual Fornication, and the burden of his galled con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience (which is alwaies heavieſt in times of danger) by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting in the continual ſcandals of his Amores, whereof the Arch-Biſhop Perefix often complains, as juſtly to be blamed<note n="*" place="margin">Pag. 461.</note> 
                     <hi>in a Chriſtian Prince, a man of his age, who was married, on whom God had conferred ſo great mercies, and who had ſuch great enterprizes in his hand.</hi> This was it which made his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of his approaching death ſo ſtrong and lamentable, and ſubjected him to the effects of that Religion to which he had ſubjected himſelf, as thoſe who conſult and crave the aſſiſtance of witches and evil ſpirits, make themſelves thereby the more obnoxious to their power and malice. Thus did he fall from that Grandure which by the ſpace of near another eighteens years he had been raiſing upon this falſe foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Such profane policies ſubjecting Religion to a ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vience to ſecular ends, though ſuccesful for a while, yet fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently at laſt concluding in an unhappy cataſtrophie. Nor could the ſpecious pretence of his grand deſign find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, who prefers obedience before ſacrifice. This was it which was in general foreſeen and foretold by our good Queen by a more genuine ſpirit of Propheſie, and from better Principles than they were moved by who foretold the ſame indeed more particularly, but yet only like witches and evil ſpirits, who foretell the ſtorms they mean to raiſe. And ſhe her ſelf, who built her aſſurance upon a better foundation, continuing conſtant to the laſt to her Conſcience and Religion, and to her God, was by him conſtantly bleſſed and preſerved to the laſt, during a Reign more than twice as long as his, and from conſpiracies neither fewer nor in themſelves leſs dangerous than thoſe againſt him: and this was it which made her to hear the full relation of a horrid conſpiracy againſt her perſon with that undaunted courage which ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed him who ſhould have been the actor of it,<note place="margin">Parry apud Cambd. an. 1585.</note> to behold it: and with admirable conſtancy to contemn the many like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies which ſhe certainly knew were at one and the ſame time by the Seminaries and Spaniſh Miniſters in agitation againſt her,<note place="margin">Cambd. an. 1594. See be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, p 26, 27. Pſ. 31.14.</note> repoſing her confidence in him whom ſhe knew was able to ſave her, with this pious ejaculation, <hi>Thou art
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:31919:140"/> my God, my times are in thy hand:</hi> not, <hi>They will kill me, I ſhall never go out of this City, I ſhall dye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="62">62. The ſame diſtinguiſhing Providence might be further obſerved in another Hiſtory, to which this is a proper intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction; but leaving that to the obſervation of others, I will here conclude with ſome <hi>REFLECTIONS AND OB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERVATIONS</hi> upon what hath been already related, that we may ſee what uſe and improvement may be made of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt <hi>in the Hiſtory of England,</hi> we may plainly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the continuance of <hi>the combination of Rome and Spain,</hi> which was the occaſion of that part of the diſcourſe, even to the very time of thoſe conſultations, which were deſigned to commence in execution immediately upon the Queens death; which may therefore reaſonably induce us to believe that it did not then ceaſe; but was continued in, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at laſt, that monſter of all devilliſh and infernal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies of blowing up the whole State at one blow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may therein alſo clearly perceive <hi>the juſtice, reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, and even neceſſity of thoſe Laws,</hi> which in the Queens Reign were made to prevent and reſtrain thoſe wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Jeſuites, and other Romiſh and Spaniſh Emiſſaries, and their diſciples; which hath been acknowledged by ſome of the more ſober Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We muſt alſo therein take notice of the <hi>admirable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God in the preſervation of that Queen</hi> from ſo many, ſo various, ſo myſterious ſecret conſpiracies, (the truth of which is further confirmed by the like practices of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh and Spaniſh Agents in France, and other places about the ſame times) and from ſo great open hoſtility, one while diverting, another while defeating her enemies, and making her victorious: and this <hi>notwithſtanding the ſeveral</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">V. ſect. 26, 33, 36.</note> 
                     <hi>excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications,</hi> and ſolemn execrations and imprecations of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Popes one after another againſt her; as of Pius 5. Greg. 13. Sixtus 5. and Clement 8. which were all not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, but rather turned into a bleſſing unto her.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In <hi>the Hiſtory of France</hi> compared with the other, that <hi>diſtinguiſhing Providence,</hi> which was the occaſion of that part
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:31919:141"/> of the diſcourſe, is no leſs conſpicuous and obſervable in a moſt remarkable judgment of God upon all thoſe who either <hi>perſecuted,</hi> or <hi>deſerted,</hi> or ſo much as <hi>refuſed or neglected</hi> that reformation of Religion which ſhe happily eſtabliſhed and defended; for in this laſt ſort alſo we have<note n="†" place="margin">V. ſect. 48. p. 97-100.</note> noted it, though by the by, and this notwithſtanding all the incitations and encouragements of ſeveral Popes and Cardinals. So that here we have a moſt <hi>remarkable example</hi> of their Curſes turned into a Bleſſing, and their Bleſſings into a Curſe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And here if we take for Principles the two laſt of Bellarmines <hi>Notes of the true Church of Chriſt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">4. De Eccleſia, c. 17.</note> the one, <hi>the unhappy exit or end of thoſe who oppoſe the Church.</hi> 
                     <q>For (as he adds) although God puniſheth his, and whips them, yet at length he caſts the rod into the fire; Deut. 32 43. Praiſe his people ye Nations, for he will avenge the blood of his ſervants,<note place="margin">C. 18.</note> and render vengance upon their adverſaries: the other, <hi>the temporal felicity by the Divine Providence conferred on thoſe who defend it.</hi> For never, ſays he, did Catholick Princes cordially adhere to God, but they moſt eaſily became triumphant over their enemies.</q> If, I ſay, we take theſe for our Principles, it will be very eaſy for any one, upon what hath been here related, to make the concluſion; viz. which is the true Church of Chriſt, and which the meretricious and adulterous; who have been true Catholick Princes, and who the Kings of the Earth who have committed fornication with the great Whore, the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints; and this will further appear from what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. And therefore <hi>in both theſe Hiſtories</hi> we may alſo take notice of <hi>the actions and practices of the Popes and their party,</hi> their Adherents, Agents, Emiſſaries and Diſciples, viz. exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and fomenting wars and invaſions among Chriſtian Princes, with breach of publick Faith; ſeditions and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions by Subjects againſt their own Princes, and the murders of Princes by their own Subjects, encouraged thereunto by an impious pretence of abſolution from their duty of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and even oaths of Fidelity, and by promiſe of Reward, even of greateſt eternal Reward, for that which hath been
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:31919:141"/> abhorred by all other Religions, and always reputed contrary even to the Laws of Nations and of War; and perſecutions and horrible ſlaughters of Chriſtian people by their own Princes: and all this by an abominable abuſe of Religion, and the moſt ſacred and ſolemn parts of Religion; and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for their own cauſe, for the upholding of the Papal Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, Uſurpations and Antichriſtian abuſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Note; The perſecutions and</hi> ſlaughters of Chriſtian people excited by the Popes, <hi>upon the account of Religion, ſince the firſt appearing of the Waldenſes and Albigenſes, may be thought, for the numbers ſlain, to come near, if not to equal the Heathen perſecutions, or rather much exceed them. In the firſt perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt that people, which were raiſed whether by the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or decree and command, as ſome ſay, of Pope Innocent</hi> 3. <hi>are reckoned to be ſlain in France alone</hi> 1000000 <hi>of people; and of later days have been reckoned</hi> 150000 <hi>Chriſtians, within the ſpace of ſcarce</hi> 30 <hi>years, conſumed by the Inquiſition. But theſe are things out of our preſent ſtory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. We may here likewiſe obſerve <hi>the nature and manner of their actions and practices,</hi> which conſiſt of the two great ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of injuſtice, <hi>vis &amp; dolus,</hi> violence and fraud, open force, and ſecret and myſterious practices and machinations, and ſo make up a compleat myſtery of iniquity. The one we may behold not only in the Spaniard's Forces raiſed and employed at the inſtigation of the Pope and his Agents, but alſo in the Forces raiſed by the Popes themſelves (who pretend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Vicars of the Prince of Peace, and as Chriſtian Biſhops, ſhould be the Preachers of Peace, and not the Trumpets of War) both againſt the Queen of England and the King of France: and the other in the ſecret practices of the Jeſuites and other Confeſſors and Emiſſaries, exciting to Rebellions, and to aſſaſſinate Princes.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And here taking <hi>another of Bellarmines Notes</hi> of the true Church,<note place="margin">Ca. 13. Mat. 7.16. Gal. 5.19, 22.</note> viz. <hi>Sanctity of Life of the Authors and Propagators of the Religion;</hi> and our Saviour's rule, <hi>By their fruits ye ſhall know them;</hi> together with his Apoſtles Catalogues of the works of the Fleſh, and of the fruits of the Spirit; for our Principles, it will not be difficult to conclude whether theſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:31919:142"/> men be the Authors or Propagators of the true Religion, (for here, for their Religion that only is to be taken about which the difference is, and for which they contend, ſeeking by theſe means to maintain and promote it) or rather of an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable innovation, and corruption of the true Religion; and whether their Church be the true and faithful Church of Chriſt,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> or rather that myſtery of iniquity, that abomination of deſolation, that man of ſin and ſon of perdition, who hath ſet up himſelf in the Temple of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. We may here alſo behold <hi>the Principles from whence all theſe actions and practices have proceeded,</hi>

That the Biſhops of Rome, as ſucceſſors of St. Peter, have a ſupreme power and authority derived to them from Chriſt over all Chriſtian Perſons and Churches, all Nations and Kingdoms, all Princes and States. 2. That by this power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they may lawfully abſolve ſubjects from all duty of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and oath of Fidelity to their otherwiſe lawful Princes and Governors; and depoſing them, may diſpoſe of their Kingdoms and States to whom they think fit. 3.

Not only the prejudice of Education, but more particularly the opinion of the Perſeverance and Infallibility of the Church, which above all things from their tender years is deeply rooted in their minds, will be a great obſtacle and ſtumbling-block in their way. But let them take heed that a too particular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a general promiſe do not deceive them. The Jews had as expreſs promiſes as any they can pretend; and were as zealous as they are now; and yet were deceived with lying words, ſaying, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, as they do now the Church, the holy Catholick Apoſtolick Roman Church.</p>

<pb n="180" facs="tcp:31919:144"/> perceive the true reaſon of it, viz. in the one caſe they were free from the moleſtation of the Popes and their Emiſſaries; and in the other they were infeſted by them. But how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle truth there is in that aſſertion may partly appear by what hath here been written, and is alſo proved by our late learned King James in his ſolid confutation of it, by inſtances not only in France but other Countries alſo. And in England who hath been more proſperous and ſuccesful than ſhe who wholly caſt off the Pope's authority, and would not be cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſo much as to admit his Legate? and who more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy than they who have too much complyed with them?</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Laſtly, we muſt here take notice of that which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but adminiſter matter of grief to all true and cordial Chriſtians; and that is <hi>the ſcandal of theſe Principles and Practices;</hi> the occaſion which thereby is given to thoſe who are not well acquainted with the Doctrines and Practices of the ancient genuine Chriſtians, nor have well conſidered the great evidences of the truth and excellence of the Chriſtian Religion, to ſuſpect it to be no other than what they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend it to be in the lives and actions of ſuch ſpurious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of it, viz. a meer Impoſture with great ſubtilty and artifice managed for ſecular ends: and <hi>the injury which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is done to the holy Martyrs,</hi> when we ſhall ſee Rebels, ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Traytors and Parricides honoured and magnified as Martyrs, and that not by the vulgar only, but by their Popes themſelves and Cardinals; by their learned Writers in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Books, and Preachers from their Pulpits; nay, when we ſhall ſee Relations in printed Books, and repreſentations by printed Cuts and Pictures of moſt horrible perſecutions and martyrdoms pretended to be ſuffered, where in truth was no ſuch matter, what a tentation may this give to weak, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned or prejudiced minds to ſuſpect that the ancient holy Martyrs either ſuffered not at all, or if they did, were only ſuch turbulent ſpirits or poor deluded ſouls as many of theſe? Nor hath the holy providence of God eſcaped their prophane abuſe by entitling it to ſuch trifles as a prudent Hiſtorian would diſdain to mention, and palpable lyes, as may be ſeen
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:31919:144"/> in Sanders, Ribadeneira, and other ſuch like Writers. To which if we add the abuſe of miracles by lyes and forgeries, we ſhall find that the gates of Hell, that is, the counſels have prevailed againſt theſe degenerate ſucceſſors of Peter with a witneſs. Nor could a more effectual means be deviſed for the ſubverſion of Chriſtianity and all Religion, not the very arms of Mahomet and his ſect, than this myſtery of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; nor, if it be well conſidered, hath the whole World pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced any thing which doth better deſerve the name of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt. And indeed, if we conſider <hi>the preſent growth of Atheiſm and Infidelity</hi> among us, and trace it to its roots and original, we ſhall find it all to be of an Italian Extraction, and from thence propagated to France, and ſo to England and other parts. Nor ſhall we find any other reaſons for it than what are here mentioned; the Italians perceiving better what is acted among themſelves, than thoſe who are more remote. For let the Italian ſubtilty be what it will, I think it is plain that they have made no deeper ſearch into either the ſecrets of Nature or of Antiquity (from one or both of which they muſt derive their principles, if they have others beſides what are here mentioned) than other Nations have made.</p>
                  <p n="63">63. And now, before I conclude, I muſt crave leave to make this <hi>addreſs to ſeveral ſorts of</hi> perſons diſtinctly. And firſt <hi>to all Chriſtians in general,</hi> that they will ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether they be not obliged for the honour and repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our holy Profeſſion, and whether our great Lord doth not require it of them, to declare againſt this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh Faction, and their Unchriſtian, or rather Antichriſtian and abominable ſcandalous principles and practices: that is <hi>all National Churches and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities publickly by ſolemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and Proteſtations,</hi> if not by excommunication; and <hi>all particular private Chriſtians</hi> by abſtaining from their commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and coming out of that Babylon, that they be not par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of her ſins, and receive not of her plagues.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>To thoſe who are not of that Communion,</hi> and have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eſcaped thoſe deluſions, that they beware that they be not again entangled therein. For it had been better for them not to
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:31919:145"/> have known the way of righteouſneſs, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment. 2. That they be careful that they do not hold the truth in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (Atrocius ſub ſancti nominis profeſſione peccatur) but walk worthy of their vocation, &amp;c. worthy of God who hath called them to his Kingdom and Glory, out of darkneſs into his marvellous light, as children of the light, and have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reprove them, and as becometh the Goſpel of Chriſt: and that while they ſeparate from the ſcandals of others, they themſelves do not adminiſter occaſion of ſcandal to others. 3. That they who are in authority, whether in Church or State, be careful both by their example and authority, as much as in them lieth, to diſcourage and ſuppreſs all manner of vice and debauchery; and to encourage and promote all manner of virtue, and particularly piety and devotion in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. For as vice and debauchery, and even coldneſs and indifference in matters of Religion in any man, makes him the more obnoxious to the deluſions of the Papiſts; ſo they well perceiving ſo much by experience, are not without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon believed to endeavour firſt the debauching of the Nation, that the people being thereby the better prepared and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to receive their impreſſions, they may the more eaſily compaſs their deſign; as Phyſitians, who cannot immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cure the preſent diſtemper of their Patient, are fain many times by art to divert it into ſome other diſeaſe which they hope more eaſily to cure. Nor do the Papiſts look upon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery as a more dangerous diſeaſe than that they call he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſy. This is ſuch a means as is of natural efficacy to obviate and obſtruct the endeavors of the Papiſts, but of all moſt likely to be effectual by the bleſſing of God upon it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the neglect of it doth both naturally expoſe the people to their deluſions, and is moſt likely to provoke the judgment of God to give them up to be deluded by them. Nor need Governors to fear that their people will prove leſs morigerous and governable, by being more devotely affected to Religion: but may well hope the contrary, provided they will require nothing of them that may be thought contrary to Religion;
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:31919:145"/> which certainly they need not, Chriſtianity containing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing inconſiſtent with any ſolid principle of policy. 4. That they be careful to walk worthy of their vocation particularly in that wherein the Apoſtle doth particularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and which he earneſtly urgeth, <hi>endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace,</hi> and<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="184" facs="tcp:31919:146"/> upon what is juſt matter of exception, we contend about that which is capable of a charitable conſtruction. That theſe conditions are neceſſary to be obſerved to make breach of communion between ſeveral Churches juſtifiable in either, I think no Chriſtian will deny. And therefore as thoſe Churches which ſhall contrary to theſe conditions make a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from others, do thereby tranſgreſs the Law of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and become guilty of Schiſm; ſo much more do they who ſhall ſo ſeparate from their own particular Church to which their habitation and abode doth ſubject them as ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial members; and beſides to their Schiſm and breach of Charity add alſo the guilt of diſobedience; and, which ought well to be conſidered among us, do thereby, though contrary to their intention, effectually cooperate with the Romiſh Agents in the promotion of their grand deſign, one of whoſe principal methods for the ſubverſion of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and reſtauration of the Popiſh Religion, as might plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be demonſtrated, is the raiſing and promoting of Sects, Factions and Diviſions among us; which were there no other obligation upon us, ought in reaſon to make us very wary how we do that which gives ſo great advantage to the common adverſary. 5. That they who are of chief autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the Church be very cautious <hi>not to adminiſter unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry occaſion of ſeparation to the weakneſs of their brethren;</hi> which may be, and frequently is done by theſe two means eſpecially; 1. <hi>By rigorous preſſing of things in their own nature indifferent.</hi> For though theſe things be left to the prudent ordering of each particular National or Provincial Church; yet when through the weakneſs and ſcrupuloſity of many they become matter of offence and ſcandal to them, and ſo occaſions of ſeparation, in that circumſtance they ceaſe to be indifferent, and it would be no leſs contrary to Prudence than to Charity to impoſe or longer ſtrictly to require them, and is plainly contrary to both the Doctrine and the Practice of the Apoſtle, (v. Rom. 14, &amp; 15. &amp; 1 Cor. 8. &amp; 9.20, 21, 22. &amp; 10.22.— and 2 Kin. 18.4.) eſpecially in ſo dangerous a circumſtance as this, when it gives ſo great advantage to ſuch an adverſary, who ſo ſtudiouſly and induſtriouſly endeavors
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:31919:146"/> our diviſions, it can never be approved as any way conſiſtent with prudence, and that care of the flock which all faithful Paſtors ought to have, not to allow at leaſt ſuch indulgence and liberty in ſuch things as is neceſſary to the preſervation of unity in the Church. 2. <hi>By ſcandalous coldneſs in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and worldlineſs in the Clergy.</hi> It is certain both from reaſon and experience, though perhaps not commonly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there is ſcarce any ſo univerſal and powerful a cauſe of ſeparation and factions as this. For the generality of people do rarely judge by any other rule than that of our Saviour, by their fruits, and are therefore very apt to judge of the truth of mens Doctrine by the virtue and piety of their lives and actions. And there is a certain authority of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which ought always to accompany authority of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, and is in truth the more powerful of the two to retain people in a ſweet, voluntary, and ſo more perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and this being loſt, the other which alone holds them only in a kind of violent and forced, not natural and genuine, obedience, is very difficult to be managed, very ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous to be caſt off, and is ſeldom of long duration. Now the former, which is the proper authority of the Church and Clergy (for what is coercive more than bare excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is in truth a branch of the Civil Authority) can never be retained by only abſtaining from thoſe we call ſcandalous ſins, but by the conſtant, ſincere and vigorous practice of thoſe great virtues of Religion, Humility, Meekneſs, Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-mindedneſs, contempt of the World, devotion in Religion, and zealous endeavors for the Salvation of Souls; without which the obſervance of the rules only of ordinary moral virtues will be attributed rather to humane Prudence than to Religion. But to ſee men zealous for the accidents and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of Religion, and cold in the practice and promotion of the great eſſential and ſubſtantial parts, and the very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of it: to hear men cry up morality as if there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more in Religion than that, and yet in the practice even of that to come far ſhort of the very Heathen Moraliſts: to ſee men prophanely turn the ſacred Profeſſion into a kind of trade; to deſign it, and apply themſelves to it no otherwiſe
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:31919:147"/> than others do to civil or ſecular employments, as a means to get a livelihood, to get wealth, honour and preferment in the World, and when they have, and perhaps by indirect means, heaped Living upon Living, and Preferment upon Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, accordingly uſe or rather abuſe the charity of our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and the revenues of the Church in ſuch indulgence to Pride, Oſtentation, voluptuous or delicious living, as would be ſcarce excuſable in the religious Laity; nay to vie with them in ſuch vanities, or inſatiably to heap up trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, not for the neceſſary relief of their own Families, but to raiſe great Families in the World, even of their more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote relations (that which the time hath been hath been held no leſs than ſacriledge) without any regard to ſuch works of Charity, and the promotion of Chriſtianity as all good Chriſtians, according to their ability, are obliged to. Theſe things, to which might be added the general decay and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the ancient diſcipline, do more effectually weaken the proper authority of the Church and Clergy, than any Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Canons or Civil Laws can eſtabliſh it; and being naucious in the ſight of the people, provoke the more religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to run to private meetings and ſects, and the reſt to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie and ſuſpitions of all Religion, to Infidelity, Irreligion and Prophaneneſs; and ſo in both give great advantage to the Romaniſts, and help forward the promotion of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and deſigns. The truth whereof is confirmed by the happy ſucceſs of thoſe who take a contrary courſe. For thanks be to God we are not without ſome, who by their good employment not only of the revenues of their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical preferments, but alſo of their private fortunes, their virtuous and pious lives, and their fervent, ſound and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Preaching, prevail with many of the ſeveral ſorts of Non-Conformiſts to become their auditors, and reclaim them. And were there ſome good and effectual courſe taken that we might have more ſuch lights ſet up in the more conſpicuous Candleſticks of the Church, we ſhould find that the moſt effectual means both to diſpel the miſts of Separatiſts, and keep out the Romiſh Foggs from overwhelming us, and to promote and eſtabliſh the honour and authority of the Church
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:31919:147"/> and Clergy. Nor would the bleſſing of God be wanting to the pious uſe of ſuch means. 6. That they, the Clergy eſpecially, will <hi>take example by their adverſaries, and not be leſs ſtudious and induſtrious</hi> by juſt and proper means to promote and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate the true Religion in its genuine purity and ſimplicity, than they their errors, abuſes and corruptions of it by indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and evil means. They compaſs Sea and Land to make Proſelytes, &amp;c. and to that end have heretofore readily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countred all difficulties and dangers, though now they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not much complain of either, and ſpare no pains nor coſt. We, of this Nation particularly, have long ſince had a large harveſt propoſed to us, and nothing wanting to encourage us to the work but our own good will and zeal for our Maſters ſervice; nay, like ſloathful ſervants have been whipped to our work, and both Conformiſts and Non Conformiſts have had their turns. It were well if at laſt we would be ſenſible of this duty, before a third party come and drive both to that which neither of themſelves would willingly undertake. Can we believe a Divine Providence, and yet think <hi>the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of that other World</hi> was a caſual thing? or can we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Divine Providence in that, and yet believe there was no other deſign in it than to employ our Sea men, or fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with Tobacco? we have reaſon to believe that this neglect hath not been diſſembled hitherto, nor will eſcape un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed for the future, unleſs timely amended. 7. That they will <hi>not be leſs vigilant and active for the preſervation of their Religion, and with it of their lives, liberties and fortunes, and all that is dear unto them, than theſe ſons of Perdition are to confound and deſtroy them;</hi> and to that end make diligent ſearch and enquiry into their preſent myſterious practices; for the diſcovery whereof much light may be taken from the due conſideration of their former practices, and of their principles. Their end in general is pretty well known; and what latitude they are like to take to themſelves in the choice of means for attaining that end, may not only be conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured by their former practices, but demonſtrated unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerably from their certain principles. From which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, though a man that is willing might eaſily ſatisfie
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:31919:148"/> himſelf what they are now doing, yet becauſe ſome who are concerned to be convinced of it, will not perhaps be ſo ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and becauſe to the more effectual prevention of ſo great a miſchief a more particular diſcovery of the matter of fact, and of the inſtruments and circumſtances of it may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, all who have any love to their Country, or regard to the intereſt and ſafety of themſelves or their relations, though the conſideration of Religion ſhould not move them, are concerned to uſe their utmoſt endeavour in it. But if nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſideration of the horrid confuſions and maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres heretofore raiſed in France by theſe Furies; nor of their continual Treaſons and Conſpiracies againſt Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth and her Kingdoms, which they then would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed to the invaſions of the King of Spain, as now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they would to the King of France, that is, thoſe who ſteer their motions, though their common agents may be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ignorant of the deſign; nor of that horrible Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Conſpiracy againſt King James, the Royal Iſſue, and flower of the Engliſh Nobility and Gentry; nor laſtly of our late Civil Wars, which may in time be juſtly proved and demonſtrated to have been the product of the Romiſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations, to which might be added their reſtleſs endeavors for the ſubverſion of our Government, and for the breaking of the great Metropolis of this Nation, as the two main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles in their way; if all this, and beſides all the ſafety of his Majeſties perſon, which perhaps may be further concerned in it than is commonly apprehended, be not ſufficient to awaken us of theſe Nations to a ſpeedy vigilance and activity before it be too late, to diſcover and detect their machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and couragiouſly oppoſe their proceedings; eſpecially thoſe who are in authority within their ſeveral Juriſdictions to look narrowly, if not into their matters of Religion, yet at leaſt into their proviſions of Arms and Ammunition, into their correſpondencies and ſecret negotiations and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and eſpecially to diſcover thoſe who under ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſguiſes not only inſinuate themſelves into familiarity with perſons of Quality, and creep into their Families un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the notions of Phyſitians, Painters, and other employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:31919:148"/> but alſo get into publick offices and employments, and perhaps to be choſen into the Parliment it ſelf; it may be feared we ſhall ere long ſmart for our ſtupidity and ſupine negligence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>To thoſe</hi> who ſtill continue <hi>of the Roman Communion,</hi> and are in danger to be drawn in to engage in ſuch under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings for the promotion of their Religion by fraud and force, by diſturbance or ſubverſion of Governments, raiſing or fomenting wars between Chriſtian Princes and States, and ſuch like means, that they will well <hi>conſider the juſtice and piety</hi> thereof. For moſt certain it is, and agreed on all hands that they are contrary to the means uſed by our Saviour, and his Apoſtles, and Diſciples, and their Succeſſors for the original propagation of the Goſpel. Nor ought it to be replyed, as ſome have impiouſly ſaid that that was for want of force, for he who could command legions of Angels is not to be thought to have wanted force if he had pleaſed to make uſe of it; nor had the Chriſtians, for many ages before theſe Unchriſtian Doctrines were ever thought of, leſs power in the World than they have had ſince, or leſs occaſion to have made uſe of it, had they thought it lawful; and beſides, it is no leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Doctrine than to their Practice. 2. The uſe of ſuch means is moſt injurious and ſcandalous to the moſt holy, pure and innocent Religion, which hath been always moſt propagated and glorified by the magnanimous, ſedate and conſtant ſufferings of its genuine Profeſſors, but always moſt diſhonoured by the furious, violent and perfidious pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the ſpurious Zealots of the abuſes of it. 3. It is contrary to the very nature of the true Religion, and the expreſs Doctrine of the ſacred Scriptures. 4. It is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the judgment of God, diſappointing, blaſting and confounding all attempts of that nature in theſe Kingdoms for near an hundred years together. Nor will their zeal and good intentions excuſe them; Paul had as much of both when he perſecuted the Chriſtians as they can have; and of the Jews he teſtifies to the Romans that they had the zeal of God, but not according to knowledge; and our Saviour fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that they who ſhould kill his Diſciples would think they do God good ſervice in it. Nor will their following of the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:31919:149"/> probable opinions of their Confeſſors excuſe them; for when blind guides lead the blind, both fall into the ditch, as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaith. Nor will it be much comfort to them who dye in their ſins through the Prieſts default, that the Prieſt alſo ſhall anſwer for it, as the Prophet ſaith. But that which is the ſecret root and main prop of their deluſion, and moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually deceives them, is an unhahpy miſtaken opinion deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rooted in their minds of the infallible authority of the particular Church of Rome. For, as Cardinal Perron hath well argued,<note place="margin">V. King James Def. of the Right of Kings.</note> if theſe things be unlawful which have for ſo many ages been acted by the Papal authority, (&amp; that interpoſed with all the formality and ſolemnity that could be) it would follow that the Pope hath been Antichriſt, and the Church of Rome the Synagogue of Satan for ſo many ages paſt. This is it, whatever other ſpecious arguments and pretenſes are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, which makes them no leſs obſtinate in their errors than the Jews are in theirs. A deceived heart hath turned them aſide, and they cannot deliver their ſoul. But if they will but, 1. Lay aſide the prejudice of Education; 2. Conſider the great evidence there is that theſe things are contrary to Chriſtianity; 3. And with that compare the little real ground there is to believe this pretended infallible authority, it may by God's bleſſing be a good means to undeceive them: but then as to the third particular they muſt deal candidly and impartially, ſetting aſide, 1. Such proofs as concern only the perſeverance of the Church of Chriſt in general, 2. Such as concern only the authority of particular Churches over their own members; for neither of theſe make any thing for the Church of Rome more than for any other particular Church; &amp; then what elſe they can alledge will be found to be far ſhort of what the Jews might alledge to prove that they are ſtill the true Iſrael of God. But the confounding of theſe things is that which impoſeth upon their minds and judgments. The ancient Apoſtolick Creed, and what-ever other rule of Faith is mentioned by Irenaeus, Tertullian, or any of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, and were held to contain the ſum of the Chriſtian Faith, are to this day generally received and believed by all the Chriſtian World: ſo that Chriſt hath ſtill a Church upon
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:31919:149"/> Earth what-ever become of the Church of Rome: the like may be ſaid of the ſacred Scriptures; but in none of theſe is the leaſt mention of any ſuch infallible authority of the Church of Rome; no, nor of any ſuch authority of the Church of Chriſt as the Church of Rome does pretend to. Nor is there any colour or pretence of proof that that autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was ever in any one age to this day the general belief of the Chriſtian World; no, nor ſo much as of the Church of Rome it ſelf for 700 years, I may truly ſay for 1100 years and more. 2. That they will likewiſe well conſider <hi>the prudence of ſuch undertakings,</hi> the Nobility and Gentry eſpecially of theſe Nations, who embrace the Roman Religion. They have had almoſt an hundred years experience of the ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and unhappy conſequence of ſuch attempts to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their party, whereby they have only made a rod for their own backs, provoking and exaſperating the ſeverity of Laws againſt themſelves; and when the Romiſh Agents had lately diſſolved the Government, and brought all things into confuſion, as is not a little apparent they did, when they had crept into the Court, and inſinuated themſelves into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Factions of the Kingdom, by underhand dealings in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſing them one againſt another, what did they advance their cauſe by it, but only involved themſelves in the ſame publick calamity wherein they embroyled the Nation? The Emiſſaries are men who have neither Eſtates nor Fortunes to loſe or hazard, nor wives and children to ſuffer with them; and if their attempts prove unſuccesful, can eaſily retire to their Colledges again beyond Sea. And their motions and actions are ſteered by foreigners, who ſit far enough out of all danger, and in great ſecurity expect to make their profit and advantage of us all. So that both theſe have hopes of advantage without any, or any great hazard, only the more honeſt and well meaning Nobility and Gentry do certainly run a very great hazard without any probability, if things be rightly calculated, of much mending their condition at the beſt. For did they now ſuffer ſomething in their Eſtates according to the Laws (which certainly would never much be preſſed, did they not continually incenſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:31919:150"/> againſt them by reſtleſs attempts, through the inſtigations of the Emiſſaries, endangering the peace and quiet of it); yet is that in ſome meaſure recompenced by their freedom from the trouble and charge of divers publick employments; and the reſt would be dearly bought off by enſlaving the Kingdom again to the Roman Uſurpations; and that with ſo much hazard both to themſelves, as in reſpect of conſcience and the juſtice of the undertaking, (for there is but little of true Chriſtianity in him who will not readily ſuffer a greater loſs, rather than venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an unlawful or but doubtful action): ſo alſo of the prudence of it; (for the higher they go in their attempts, there is no doubt but it will fall more heavy upon them, after ſo many and great provocations, if they miſcarry therein, and of that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is greater than can eaſily be foreſeen); and to the Kingdom in general, the peace and proſperity whereof they ought to deſire and endeavour upon the account both of natural duty and of intereſt. For whatever ſome, who do not well conſider it, may promiſe themſelves, thoſe who have Eſtates and Fortunes here, be their Religion what it will, are like to have their ſhares of whatever publick calamity or miſchief is brought upon the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which they who at Rome and from other foreign parts do ſteer the motions of the Emiſſaries and other ſticklers here in that cauſe, are not much concerned to conſider. * * *</p>
                  <p n="4">4. And laſtly, <hi>to thoſe who</hi> either through weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderateneſs <hi>are ſcandalized</hi> at theſe and ſuch like wicked pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices of the Romaniſts or any others profeſſing Chriſtianity; or through wilfulneſs and wickedneſs do make uſe thereof to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm or encourage themſelves in their affected infidelity, who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving firſt ſinned themſelves into deſpair of any good by the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of Religion, at laſt ſeek to encourage themſelves againſt all fear of evil by the neglect of it. This laſt ſort I intended not among Chriſtians in general, and yet do here joyn them with the other ſort here mentioned, becauſe what is to be ſaid to thoſe may be ſaid alſo to theſe. The ſcandal and ill uſe that is made of theſe practices is either more particular from abuſe of preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded miracles and martyrdoms, whereby ſome may be induced to doubt of the ancient Chriſtian Miracles and Martyrs; (and for ſatisfaction in this particular, I ſhall here for brevity ſake refer
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:31919:150"/> them to the writings already written and extant in print, ſome in the Engliſh Tongue, of the verity of the Chriſtian Religion) or from ſuch practices in general, of men in great place in Church or State, or repute for Learning, as are thought inconſiſtent with a real belief of what they poſſeſs, whence ſome who affect to know more than the vulgar will needs perſwade themſelves and others that all ſuch are Atheiſts and Infidels, and thereupon bring all Religion under a ſuſpition of being nothing elſe but a more refined piece of policy; and becauſe I have found by experience that many have no better arguments for their affected infidelity than this, and yet few of thoſe who have written of the verity of the Chriſtian Religion have taken any notice of it, or thought it worth a particular anſwer, I ſhall recommend theſe things to their conſideration: 1. That this is no argument or evidence againſt Religion, but only a bare ſuppoſed opinion and judgment of ſuch perſons without any evident and expreſs ground or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it. 2. That the opinion or judgment of great Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or Scholars, meerly as ſuch, is of no greater authority in this particular than the judgment or opinion of other men; for ſuch men may in general well deſerve that reputation which they have, and yet be utterly ignorant of thoſe Principles which are neceſſary to be known to ground a judgment in this caſe. There are very rarely found any men that are well skilled in all the parts of Learning, or of ſome one profeſſion; as for example of the Law, ſome are good Conveyancers, who are very unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Bar-Practice; many good Chancery-men who are no great Common Lawyers, &amp;c. So in Divinity, ſome are well skilled in Textual, ſome in Polemical, or Scholaſtical, ſome in Caſuiſtical Divinity, and yet but meanly skilled in the other parts of it; and this part which conſiders the evidences of Religion, is but rarely ſtudied by any but ſuch as have to do with Infidels, each man or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily applying himſelf eſpecially to that part to which his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar employment engageth him, and uſually men in great place have of all others leaſt leiſure for this particular ſtudy. 3. But were their judgment never ſo conſiderable, yet could it not in this caſe be certainly concluded from their actions. For, 1. It is agreed by all ſorts of men, Chriſtians and Heathens, and daily experience confirmeth the ſame, that men frequently act contrary
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:31919:151"/> to their ſetled judgment; and who may not often truly ſay, Video meliora probo<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> deteriora ſequor? Nor is the thing it ſelf more apparent than the reaſons of it. But I ſhall not here trace it to its firſt and original cauſes, but only ſhew it in its next and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate cauſes, which are Surprize, Impotence, and Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. From <hi>Surprize</hi> there is certainly no man whoſe care and caution can always ſecure him, that he may not ſometimes through the heat of paſſion or ſuddenneſs of a tentation be<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 6.1.</note> overtaken. This we may all obſerve in our ſelves, and in moſt we familiarly converſe with. Nay, our very caution it ſelf in many things makes us apt to be ſurprized by fear, and thereupon to do thoſe things we otherwiſe would not, or neglect what we would otherwiſe do. And though there be not a like <hi>Impotence</hi> in all, yet is there more or leſs in every one, whence men often do themſelves contrary to what they would adviſe their children or deareſt friends. We daily ſee thoſe who doubt not the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Phyſitians to be good and neceſſary to be obſerved, yet frequently overcome to tranſgreſs them to the hazard of their health and life it ſelf; nay Phyſitians themſelves do the ſame, whereof I could give a late notable inſtance in one of the moſt famous of his time. Nor are we to think great Stateſmen, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lititians and learned men more exempt from all impotence than others are. It is ſufficient that they be well qualified for the places they hold, to which their very impotence in ſome reſpects may ſometime be a ſpecial qualification; and they who are not eaſily overcome by one paſſion or affection, may yet be perfectly enſlaved to another. What is wanting to theſe two cauſes is frequently made up by <hi>Preſumption,</hi> whether upon God's mercy in general, and hope of pardon upon an intended repentance af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward, or upon the priviledg of being within the pale of the Church by profeſſion of Chriſtianity, or being members of the Catholick Church, or zealous for the party they eſpouſe, that is as the Prophet ſaith, <hi>Truſting in lying words, ſaying, The Temple of the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 7.3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord;</hi> a Preſumption ſo powerful heretofore, that notwithſtanding that reproof, and after a notable experience of the vanity of it, we find it in our Saviour's days ſtill continued, and again reproved by John Baptiſt; Think not to ſay within your ſelves we have
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:31919:151"/> Abraham to our Father, &amp;c. Mat. 3.9. And yet after all this, as experience ſheweth, ſtill prevalent in our days, and very common among the Romaniſts and the Diſciples of the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuites, eſpecially their new Proſelytes, who ſeem to hope for indulgence in their ſinful courſes, or to expiate the ſame, by their zeal for the Church; whereunto great occaſion is given by their abominable abuſe of Abſolution, Commutation of Penance, Indulgences and complying Conduct. 2. Theſe actions may proceed from <hi>error in the underſtanding,</hi> and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or miſtake about ſome particular Chriſtian Doctrine, through an <hi>erronious Conſcience</hi> thinking that to be lawful, or a Chriſtian duty, which is abſolutely unlawful;<note place="margin">So our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our telleth his Diſciples that they who ſhould kill them would think they do God ſervice, Jo. 16.2. and Saul thought that he ought to perſecute the Chriſtians, Act. 26.9.</note> and this may be conſiſtent with a firm belief of the Chriſtian Doctrine in general. And this I take to be in truth the caſe of the Romaniſts, and that they are given up to believe a lye through ſtrong deluſions, wherein they do not more deceive their diſciples than they are themſelves deceived; for do but admit me one or two of their Principles, and there is nothing ſo monſtrous in their actions but I think I can eaſily prove it lawful. I had therefore intended to have ſhewed from what Principles thoſe actions have proceeded; that thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are miſtaken, and are no Chriſtian but rather Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Doctrines; what hath been the cauſe; occaſion and progreſs of that miſtake; and laſtly, that this defection from the Chriſtian Doctrine and Manners hath been foretold by the firſt Propagators of the Chriſtian Faith, in that manner as I think would not only do much to the removing of the ſcandal, but moreover afford no inconſiderable evidence to the truth of Chriſtianity it ſelf: but that I ſee would be too long for this place and time; but I am well aſſured of the truth of what I ſay, and doubt not but ere long it will be made manifeſt. 3. There is one cauſe more from whence men may act contrary to Chriſtianity, and that in the higheſt degree, and yet without the disbelief of the Truth of it in general, or of any particular Doctrine of it: and that is through <hi>deſperation,</hi> the caſe of ſome who believe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Ja. 2.19. When men by frequency and long continuance in ſin againſt the light and checks of conſcience have ſinned
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:31919:152"/> themſelves into this deſperation, this is often an occaſion to them to a further progreſs in wickedneſs, even to the height of the moſt enormous ſins, though they neither do, nor can doubt of the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, no more than do the Devils who believe and tremble; for there is no ſin which is not conſiſtent with a full perſwaſion of it in ſuch as are once become deſperate indeed. Even ſcoffing at and abuſe of Religion to evil ends are no certain arguments of unbelief in ſuch as uſe them. There may be and are falſe Profeſſors of Atheiſm and Infidelity as well as of Religion it ſelf. There is more or leſs of humane frailty in all. Too many ſin againſt knowledg, and ſome thereby ſin themſelves into deſpair, and then run on into all wickedneſs againſt that Belief which they would fain caſt off if they could. And there are ſo many cauſes and occaſions of ſins beſides unbelief, that they cannot in reaſon be attributed to it alone. 4. And laſtly, conſidering the ſtrange wild fancies, which we often ſee men, learned men, and otherwiſe ſober men, fall into; conſidering the great force &amp; prevalence that the will &amp; affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions have to byaſs, blind, and corrupt the judgment; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the power, and malice, and ſubtilty that, according to the Scriptures, the God of this World hath to blind mens minds that they ſhould not believe the Goſpel of Truth, it is not to be doubted but ſuch there are who do not believe it; but then the very ſame reaſons may ſatisfy us what little cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit there is to be given to the opinions of ſuch men, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out better reaſon: and yet I know and have found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience that ſome profeſſors of Infidelity have no better rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons than this; they are like men in a panick fear, where every one is afraid, but none knoweth the cauſe, only he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the reſt do, and is ſo much the more afraid by how much the more in number they are whom he ſuppoſeth to be in the ſame paſſion with himſelf: ſo, many who have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon at all for their unbelief, yet ſuppoſe others have, and would fain be thought as wiſe as they.</p>
                  <p>This I thought neceſſary to add as an Antidote againſt that poiſon which ſome might ſuck from thoſe ſcandalous Practices and Actions which have been here related.</p>
